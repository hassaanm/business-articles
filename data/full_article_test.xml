		<content>Apple’s iPad and the Human Costs for Workers in China - NYTimes.com “You can set all the rules you want, but they’re meaningless if you don’t give suppliers enough profit to treat workers well,” said one former Apple executive with firsthand knowledge of the supplier responsibility group. “If you squeeze margins, you’re forcing them to cut safety.” Wintek is still one of Apple’s most important suppliers. Wintek, in a statement, declined to comment except to say that after the episode, the company took “ample measures” to address the situation and “is committed to ensuring employee welfare and creating a safe and healthy work environment.” Many major technology companies have worked with factories where conditions are troubling. However, independent monitors and suppliers say some act differently. Executives at multiple suppliers, in interviews, said that Hewlett-Packard and others allowed them slightly more profits and other allowances if they were used to improve worker conditions. “Our suppliers are very open with us,” said Zoe McMahon, an executive in Hewlett-Packard’s supply chain social and environmental responsibility program. “They let us know when they are struggling to meet our expectations, and that influences our decisions.” On the afternoon of the blast at the iPad plant, Lai Xiaodong telephoned his girlfriend, as he did every day. They had hoped to see each other that evening, but Mr. Lai’s manager said he had to work overtime, he told her. He had been promoted quickly at Foxconn, and after just a few months was in charge of a team that maintained the machines that polished iPad cases. The sanding area was loud and hazy with aluminum dust. Workers wore masks and earplugs, but no matter how many times they showered, they were recognizable by the slight aluminum sparkle in their hair and at the corners of their eyes. Just two weeks before the explosion, an advocacy group in Hong Kong published a report warning of unsafe conditions at the Chengdu plant, including problems with aluminum dust. The group, Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, or Sacom, had videotaped workers covered with tiny aluminum particles. “Occupational health and safety issues in Chengdu are alarming,” . “Workers also highlight the problem of poor ventilation and inadequate personal protective equipment.” A copy of that report was sent to Apple. “There was no response,” said Debby Chan Sze Wan of the group. “A few months later I went to Cupertino, and went into the Apple lobby, but no one would meet with me. I’ve never heard from anyone from Apple at all.” The morning of the explosion, Mr. Lai rode his bicycle to work. The iPad had gone on sale just weeks earlier, and workers were told thousands of cases needed to be polished each day. The factory was frantic, employees said. Rows of machines buffed cases as masked employees pushed buttons. Large air ducts hovered over each station, but they could not keep up with the three lines of machines polishing nonstop. Aluminum dust was everywhere. Dust is a known safety hazard. In 2003, an aluminum dust explosion in Indiana destroyed a wheel factory and killed a worker. In 2008, agricultural dust inside a sugar factory in Georgia Two hours into Mr. Lai’s second shift, the building started to shake, as if an earthquake was under way. There was a series of blasts, plant workers said. When Mr. Lai’s colleagues ran outside, dark smoke was mixing with a light rain, according to cellphone videos. The toll would eventually count four dead, 18 injured. At the hospital, Mr. Lai’s girlfriend saw that his skin was almost completely burned away. “I recognized him from his legs, otherwise I wouldn’t know who that person was,” she said. Eventually, his family arrived. Over 90 percent of his body had been seared. “My mom ran away from the room at the first sight of him. I cried. Nobody could stand it,” his brother said. When his mother eventually returned, she tried to avoid touching her son, for fear that it would cause pain. After Mr. Lai died, Foxconn workers drove to Mr. Lai’s hometown and delivered a box of ashes. The company later wired a check for about $150,000.</content>

The truth is that the regulations will create new jobs in clean-energy industries and, most importantly, save the planet.” Rising commodity prices are due to supply and demand, says Paul Krugman, who also debunks the excessive government spending myth.

He said that this helps make employees stewards of their health care. They will give more consideration to how they use their health care dollars if they control it.” WORST PREDICTION FROM A VERY SMART GUY: Paul Krugman is smart but not all of his predictions have panned out, particularly this one from 1998: “The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in ‘Metcalfe’s law’ — which states that the number of potential connections in a network is proportional to the square of the number of participants — becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.” What’s your small-business New Year’s resolution?

		<content>NetApp to Buy LSI's Engenio for $480 Million - NYTimes.com NetApp announced on Wednesday afternoon that it has agreed to buy Engenio, an external storage business owned by the LSI Corporation, for $480 million in cash. The acquisition, which is expected to close in 60 days, should add to NetApp’s earnings by the end of the second quarter in 2012. “We’re excited about the acquisition of the Engenio business and the opportunity to significantly expand our addressable market and generate greater revenue growth,” Tom Georgens, NetApp’s chief executive, said in a statement. Article Tools Related Links NetApp press release In the data storage market, a battle is under way to bulk up. NetApp’s deal comes just days after Western Digital said it would buy Hitachi Global Storage Technologies for $4.3 billion. Late last year, EMC purchased Isilon Systems for $2.25 billion. The wave of consolidation is rooted in rising data storage needs, as more corporations shift to cloud computing and require more space to save and process bulky files and applications. In a conference call on Wednesday, NetApp said the acquisition would help it reach new customers and significantly expand its market. In particular, Mr. Georgens said, Engenio attracts clients who need high performance and significant bandwidth, like those who use complex video applications or programs for genomics sequencing. With Engenio, NetApp believes its addressable market will increase by $5 billion by 2014. “NetApp’s channel-friendly approach is highly synergistic with the Engenio model of enabling partner and customer success, and the combination should further advance the Engenio storage platform,” LSI’s chief executive, Abhi Talwalkar, said in a statement. In recent years, NetApp itself has been the subject of takeover rumors. Last September, Oracle’s chief, Lawrence J. Ellison, told financial analysts that he would “love” to have part of NetApp’s storage business, at the least. NetApp’s revenue has jumped more than 25 percent in each of the last three quarters. And the company now ranks behind EMC and I.B.M. in terms of market share, according to the research firm IDC. Shares of NetApp, which announced the deal after the market closed, fell 11 cents on Wednesday, to $51.41.</content>

		<content>Explanations and Advice for Those Hit Hardest by New Tax Increases - NYTimes.com WHILE the affluent will pay more in taxes this year, that is probably not the case for the very wealthiest — those worth hundreds of millions or more. They may still be paying a lower tax rate than Warren Buffett’s secretary. Many millionaires are certainly paying at least 30 percent of their income in taxes, a goal President Obama set out in last year’s State of the Union address. But they’re more likely to be doctors, lawyers and people working in the financial services industry who get the bulk of their earnings in the form of paychecks. Partners in private equity firms and hedge fund managers, on the other hand, earn much of their money as a share of their funds’ earnings. And that income gets preferential tax treatment as so-called carried interest. A similar special tax treatment still holds true for Mr. Buffett as long as the bulk of his income comes from his investments and not a paycheck. The long-term capital gains rate for incomes over $400,000 is 23.8 percent, including the Medicare surcharge. That’s a far cry from the top marginal tax rate on income above that amount of 40.5 percent, which includes a 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge on earned income. How are people going to react to all of this? Here is advice and observations from some experts in wealth management: This year, income taxes are going up for almost everyone, even if the taxes go by different names. Greg Rosica, a tax partner at Ernst and Young and a contributing author to the firm’s tax guide, laid out five tiers where taxes are increasing. The bottom one includes everyone who receives a paycheck and is affected by the 2 percentage point increase in the payroll tax. In the top one are couples making more than $450,000 a year, who will pay higher rates on income and investments, be subject to the Medicare surcharges of 0.9 percent on income and 3.8 percent on investments and lose some portion of their itemized deductions and exemptions. Using assumptions on wages and deductions from Internal Revenue Service statistics, Mr. Rosica calculated that a person making $500,000 a year would pay $9,124, or 7 percent, more in taxes in 2013. A couple earning $1 million a year in wages and business and investment income would pay $53,350 extra, or 20 percent more in taxes. “It’s hitting every line item of income,” he said. “It’s phasing in all the way up the scale.” This has made strategies that defer income more attractive than they were in the years when George W. Bush was president and tax rates were historically low. “At the base level, it’s plans. Or, for the self-employed person or person who sits on boards, they can defer into a SEP I.R.A.,” a plan for the self-employed, or into one’s own defined-benefit plan, said Christopher Zander, the national head of wealth planning at Evercore Wealth Management. “That’s very attractive. Even if income tax rates are higher later, I think the tax deferral” makes up for that increase. There are risks, though. People could defer too much into a qualified plan, like an I.R.A., and end up having to pay a penalty if they need the money before they turn 59 1/2 years old. Or they could put too much into a company-sponsored deferred-compensation plan and face two problems. The company could go bankrupt, as Lehman Brothers did, and they could lose that money, or the payout schedule they selected when they put the money in — say 10 annual payments at retirement — may end up providing them with too much or too little income. At the very top of the income ladder, the group for whom the changes in the tax code will not hurt as much includes people like hedge fund managers and private equity partners whose earnings come in the form of carried interest. The income for these people comes from the fees they charge, and that income will continue to be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. “Carried interest rules are helpful for hedge fund managers, but they’re incredibly helpful for private equity guys,” said Richard A. Rosenberg, a certified public accountant and co-founder of RR Advisory Group, which advises hedge fund and private equity partners. “Private equity funds typically get the stronger treatment because there is less turnover and the holding periods of the funds are longer.”</content>

		<content>Carrefour Approached for Brazil Merger - NYTimes.com Paulo Fridman/BloombergCarrefour operates stores under the Dia brand in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Carrefour, the giant French retailer, said on Tuesday that it had received an offer to merge its Brazilian operations with those of Companhia Brasileira de Distribuição, owned by Grupo Pão de Açúcar. The joint venture, proposed by the investment firm Gama, would create the largest retail company in Brazil, with total combined sales estimated at 30 billion euros ($43 billion) this year. But the deal is being contested by Carrefour’s French rival, Casino, which owns a large stake in Grupo Pão de Açúcar. Article Tools To finance the deal, Gama has said it has commitments for 2.5 billion euros in new capital and debt from its parent, BTG Pactual, and the Brazilian National Development Bank. Gama and Carrefour would split the ownership of the joint venture 50-50, and the investment firm would take an 11.7 percent interest in the French retailer through an issuance of new preferred shares. Gama would also purchase up to 6 percent of Carrefour shares on the open market, making it the company’s largest shareholder. Gama said it would strike a shareholder agreement with other big Carrefour investors — Blue Capital, Colony Blue Investor and Groupe Arnault — which together control 14 percent of Carrefour’s shares and more than 20 percent of the voting rights. On Tuesday morning, Carrefour’s shares rose 78 cents, or 2.93 percent, to 27.23 euros in trading in Paris. In September, the shares were trading at more than 41 euros, but have since slumped as growth has stagnated in its home markets. Gama said the combined company would have 2,386 stores in Brazil, and it estimated annual cost savings of 700 million euros from the deal. One potential obstacle is Carrefour’s rival Casino, which has a 37 percent stake in Grupo Pão de Açúcar. Casino has taken the president of Grupo Pão de Açúcar, Abilio Diniz, to court for not disclosing talks with Carrefour. The retailerreacted harshly to the Carrefour announcement on Tuesday, saying “it is not a spontaneous proposal from Gama, a financial investment vehicle, but a long-standing illegal planned financial transaction between Carrefour and Abilio Diniz.” Casino said it “has the authority to oppose this project according to the existing agreements,” and that it would “examine how to best defend the corporate interests of C.B.D. and its shareholders” from a transaction of an “obvious hostile nature.” Casino shares slid sharply on Tuesday, falling 2.73 euros, or 4.14 percent, to 63.17 euros in Paris trading.</content>

		<content>ATandT Deal Joins a History of Antitrust Fights - NYTimes.com 6:38 p.m. | Updated ATandT’s deal to buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion is shaping up to be a heated regulatory battle. Article Tools Federal trade and communications regulators, along with the Justice Department, must bless the deal, which would create the nation’s largest cellular carrier. Lawmakers are already denouncing the deal, saying it will reduce competition in an already consolidated industry. The deal is the latest in a long line of mega-mergers to raise antitrust concerns. Here’s a look at other prominent transactions that set off controversy in Washington. Comcast-NBC Universal DEAL: Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, agreed to acquire 51 percent of NBC Universal for about $13.75 billion from General Electric in December 2009, capping nearly nine months of negotiations. OBSTACLES: Democrats on Capitol Hill initially objected, contending the deal would constrain programming choices for consumers and result in higher cable-TV subscription prices. OUTCOME: It took more than a year, but the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department finally agreed to the merger in January. The approval came with several conditions, including measures to curb Comcast’s control of the online video marketplace. AOL-Time Warner DEAL: America Online agreed in January 2000 to buy Time Warner for $165 billion, the biggest merger in history. OBSTACLES: The merger involved an area largely unfamiliar to regulators, the Internet. OUTCOME: The deal closed in January 2001, with the F.C.C. requiring AOL to open up its instant messaging services to make them more compatible with rivals’. The deal proved to be ill-fated. The combined company faced turf battles, an accounting scandal, plummeting stock price and shareholder lawsuits, ultimately forcing the businesses into a bitter divorce. WorldCom-MCI DEAL: MCI Communications, at the time the nation’s second-largest long-distance telephone company, agreed in November 1997 to sell itself to WorldCom for about $36.5 billion in cash and stock. OBSTACLES: Consumer groups rallied against the deal, complaining it would send phone service prices through the roof. OUTCOME: In the summer of 1998, the Justice Department and European regulators signed off on the deal, after MCI agreed to sell its Internet business. Following an accounting scandal, WorldCom filed what was then the largest bankruptcy in United States history. The company’s chief executive was later convicted of fraud. WorldCom-Sprint DEAL: Following the acquisition of MCI, WorldCom set it sights on the Sprint Corporation in 1999, offering more than $100 billion for the long-distance company. OBSTACLES: Regulators were skeptical of the deal from the start, worried it would further stifle competition on the heels of the MCI takeover. OUTCOME: WorldCom and Sprint abandoned their merger in July 2000. ATandT-BellSouth DEAL: ATandT’s bid for T-Mobile is hardly its first major move. In March 2006, the telecom giant agreed to buy the BellSouth Corporation for around $83 billion. OBSTACLES: While the Justice Department cleared the way for the merger to advance, the F.C.C. was caught up in an internal debate over whether one of its members was allowed to vote on the deal. Robert M. McDowell, an F.C.C. commissioner — a former lobbyist for the telecommunications industry — abstained, leaving the commission deadlocked. OUTCOME: The agency approved the deal in late 2006 without Mr. McDowell’s vote, after the companies agreed to several concessions over network neutrality.</content>

		<content>Investment Firm Founder Charged With Trying to Defraud NBA Union - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (Reuters) - The founder and managing director of Prim Capital Corporation has been charged with attempting to defraud the National Basketball Association players' union out of $3 million with a bogus contract, federal prosecutors in Manhattan said. A complaint unsealed on Thursday charges Ohio-based Prim Capital founder Joseph Lombardo, 72, with attempted wire fraud, attempted mail fraud and obstruction of justice. Carolyn Kaufman, 72, who served as president of Prim's advisory services component, was charged with obstructing justice. From 2001 until 2013, Prim Capital served as the primary outside investment advisory firm handling the investments and finances for the New York-based National Basketball Players Association, the union representing NBA players. Prim, described on its website as a boutique investment banking firm, managed up to $250 million of the NBPA's assets, reviewed individual players' investments and conducted financial seminars for players, federal prosecutors said. Prim was asked to turn over copies of its agreements with the NBPA in 2012 as part of a probe by the U.S. Department of Labor into potential criminal activity at the union, according to the complaint. Several months later, the firm produced another contract listing the firm's annual fee at $602,000 for a five-year term, prosecutors said. But an investigation showed that a signature from former NBPA general counsel, Gary Hall, on the contract had been forged months after his death, prosecutors said. Another signature on the contract was allegedly forged as well, according to the prosecutor's office. Lombardo and Kaufman are charged with trying to thwart a grand jury investigation and giving false testimony. "As alleged, Joseph Lombardo faked the signature of a dead man as part of manufacturing a multi-million dollar contract out of whole cloth that, had it been enforced, would have caused significant losses for basketball players who entrusted him with their savings," U.S. attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. "And together with his partner in crime, Carolyn Kaufman, he allegedly lied about it to a federal grand jury." Lombardo and Kaufman were arrested at their residences in Ohio on Thursday, and will make their initial appearances in Manhattan federal court on May 2, according to the Manhattan prosecutor's office. Lombardo faces up to 20 years on each fraud charge. He and Kaufman face up to 20 years on the obstruction of justice charge. A lawyer who represented Lombardo and Kaufman during a court hearing in Ohio was not immediately available for comment Thursday evening. Prim Capital and the NBPA did not immediately return requests for comment.</content>

		<content>Why the Jefferies Deal Could Worry Wall Street's Giants - NYTimes.com Librado Romero/The New York TimesSales traders at the Jefferies Group in Manhattan in 2006. Is the Jefferies Group, the pint-size investment bank, really a more valuable franchise than the mighty Goldman Sachs? The Leucadia National Corporation announced Monday that it planned to acquire Jefferies for $3.6 billion. At that price, Leucadia is paying 1.2 times the firm’s tangible book value, a measure of a company’s worth. The important point is that a large financial company is willing to put down real money to acquire a brokerage firm, paying more than its tangible book value. Right now, firms like Goldman and Morgan Stanley would be happy just to see their shares trade above book. The stock market values Goldman at 0.9 times its tangible book value. Investors are even less sanguine about Morgan Stanley, awarding it a price to book value of only 0.6 times. Article Tools Related Links With Jefferies Deal, ‘Baby Berkshire’ Deviates From Buffett There seems to be little reason for Jefferies to have a superior valuation. It has a credit rating of Baa3 from Moody’s, three notches below Goldman’s rating of A3. Jefferies is paying around 6.2 percent when it borrows for longer periods in the market, whereas Goldman is paying only 2.1 percent. Solid credit ratings and a low cost of borrowing are critical for investment banks, which rely on markets for their financing. Small investment banks like Jefferies are clearly vulnerable to market angst. Last year, the company’s stock price plunged 60 percent on fears over its holdings of European sovereign debt. So what explains the valuation gap? One theory is that the market is unduly pessimistic about the health of Morgan Stanley and Goldman. The companies’ valuations have actually improved as their stock prices have risen. That could continue until they trade about tangible book, especially if global markets continue to stabilize, economic growth strengthens and the uncertainty surrounding new Wall Street regulations lifts. The alternative view is that the market doesn’t like the size and complexity of Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which also have higher leverage than smaller investment banks. With their “too big to fail” status, firms like Goldman and Morgan Stanley have had to hold more capital since the financial crisis of 2008. That depresses metrics like “return on equity,” which investors track when deciding whether to buy stock in investment banks. If investors believe regulations permanently cap returns at lackluster levels, they will be loath to pay more than book value. The big Wall Street firms may then decide to exit certain businesses and downsize. UBS recently announced plans to do this, causing its shares to leap. All this suggests that the government’s soft-handed approach to the “too big to fail” problem may be working. Instead of forcing size explicit limitations on large banks, the overhaul focused on rules that effectively gave financial firms incentives to opt for simpler businesses and avoid excessive growth. A simple, small balance sheet meant Jefferies could sell itself for a premium price. Given the current valuations, Goldman and Morgan Stanley may want to pay attention.</content>

		<content>Regulators Close 2 Banks, Bringing Total to 25 in 2009 - NYTimes.com Article Tools Banks in Missouri and Nevada were seized by regulators, bringing the total of federally insured failed banks to 25. The total equals the number of banks shuttered in all of last year, as the recession drives up unemployment and home foreclosures. American Sterling Bank of Sugar Creek, Mo., and the Great Basin Bank of Nevada in Elko were closed. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was named receiver. Metcalf Bank of Lee’s Summit, Mo., will assume deposits of American Sterling and take control of the five branches. Metcalf Bank will buy about $173.6 million of American Sterling’s assets, with the F.D.I.C. sharing the losses on $100 million of them. Nevada State Bank of Las Vegas, a unit of Zions Bancorporation, based in Salt Lake City, becomes the owner of Great Basin’s five offices and is assuming the bank’s deposits.

		<content>Despite Deal With TPG, Speculation That Par Could Garner Higher Bids - NYTimes.com Shares of Par Pharmaceutical Companies surged more than 40 percent on Monday after the private equity firm TPG said it had reached a deal to acquire the firm for $1.9 billion, or $50 a share. But some in the industry believe that the TPG bid is below the company’s true value, indicating that other suitors could surface. In a note on Monday, an analyst at UBS, Ami Fadia, said potential takeover bids from another company could reach as high as $60 a share. She also raised her 12-month price target on the stock to $58 a share, well above TPG’s offering price. “We believe that this business can easily generate cash flows of about $200 million to $250 million a year, which we value at closer to $60 a share in the hands of a strategic buyer who would be able to drive synergies,” Ms. Fadia wrote in a note. She says any rival bidders would likely be foreign generic drug companies that are looking to expand into the United States. Article Tools Related Links TPG to Buy Par Pharmaceutical for $1.9 Billion Another analyst, Kevin Kedra at Gabelli and Company, pegs the company’s value even higher, at $67 a share, also adding that rival suitors would likely be foreign firms. “Likely buyers would probably be a specialty pharmaceutical company or an international company – maybe a European company that’s looking to make a big move into the U.S.” he says. Par’s board unanimously approved TPG’s buyout offer, but did indicate it would seek out third-party bids through Aug. 24. However, it’s not clear if Par would have to pay a break-up fee if it finds a superior offer and walks away from its deal with TPG. A spokesman for the company was not immediately available for comment on the matter. The TPG deal requires approval from Par shareholders to proceed. At least two law firms – Levi and Korsinsky and Bernstein Liebhard – issued statements indicating they’re investigating the company’s board for possible breaches in fiduciary duty in connection with the agreement to sell to TPG. The law firms said they would examine whether the board failed to adequately shop the company before reaching the deal with TPG, and whether TPG is underpaying for Par’s shares. Par , which develops, makes and markets generic drugs and niche proprietary pharmaceuticals, has more than 60 products on the market, 28 drugs awaiting approval from the Food and Drug Administration and more than 30 in active development. That pipeline could make it attractive to companies in the industry like Novartis’s Sandoz unit, Ranbaxy, Stada Arzneimittel and Sun Pharmaceutical, analysts said. Par’s chief executive, Patrick G. LePore, said the board considers TPG a good fit for the company’s long-term growth. “While my focus and that of the Par board of directors was on shareholder value, we are very pleased that Par will be acquired by TPG, a leading global private investment firm whose substantial resources and healthcare experience will enable Par to continue to invest in its future long-term growth,” he said in statement. Monday morning, Par’s stock jump as high as $52.22 before pulling back slightly. It closed the day at $50 a share, exactly at TPG’s offer price.</content>

		<content>Automakers Target Chinese Buyers at Shanghai Show - NYTimes.com SHANGHAI (AP) — Global and Chinese automakers showcased family-friendly sedans and SUVs targeting coveted urban buyers at China's biggest auto show Saturday as competition intensifies in this huge but crowded market. China's vehicle sales rose 13 percent in March, blistering growth by Western standards but down from 45 percent in 2009. With sales weak elsewhere, global companies that see China as a key part of their future are pouring money and technology into fighting for market share, squeezing each other and new but ambitious local automakers. "It is a very, very competitive market," said Bob Socia, president of General Motors Co.'s China arm. The Shanghai auto show, held in alternate years, has grown into one of the global industry's most prominent events, especially after China passed the United States in 2009 as the biggest auto market by number of vehicles sold. Organizers say exhibitors at this year's show, which opens to the public after Saturday's press preview, will display more than 800 vehicles, from mass-market compacts to minivans to hand-built sports cars with price tags of more than $1 million. GM is displaying 53 models from its Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet units as well as its local Baojun and Wuling brands. GM says it will launch 17 new and refreshed models in China this year and wants to expand Cadillac's share of the country's booming luxury market. Ford Motor Co. unveiled a new version of its Mondeo sedan and the sport model of its smaller Focus ST aimed at prosperous, family-conscious Chinese buyers. Marin Burela, the president of Ford's main Chinese joint venture, said the Mondeo is aimed at luring Chinese buyers with "affordable luxury." Italy's Fiat SpA, trying to catch up after launching its first China venture just three years ago, unveiled a version of its Viaggio sedan and a SUV, the Freemont, based on the Dodge Journey. Fiat said the Viaggio, with a smaller 1.4-liter engine than models sold elsewhere, was its first vehicle designed for the China market. China's auto sales last year topped 19 million. Industry analysts and automakers say they expect rapid growth to continue, rising to annual sales of as much as 32 million vehicles by 2020 — the equivalent of the United States and Europe combined. "China really is in the infancy of industry development," said David Schoch, Ford's president for Asia and the Pacific. Ford expects 60 to 70 percent of its sales growth to come from the Asia-Pacific region in coming years, he said, "and most of that is driven by the China engine." Despite rapid sales growth that has left Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities choked on traffic and smog, competition has been brutal, forcing fledgling Chinese automakers to merge in hopes of competing with bigger global rivals. Ford's local partner, Chang'an Automotive Group, swallowed rivals Changhe and Hafei and a series of smaller producers. Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp., which assembles vehicles for GM and VW, absorbed Nanjing Automotive. Still, the market is fragmented among more than 100 brands and some domestic producers have sales of just 1,000 to 2,000 vehicles a year. Germany's Volkswagen AG is China's biggest single auto brand with a 14 percent market share. GM is second with 7 percent for cars, plus its truck and minivan sales. Ford, Honda Motor Co. and leading Chinese brands such as Chery Inc. and Geely Holding Group, which owns Sweden's Volvo Cars, have shares of 2 to 4 percent. The squeeze on independent Chinese brands has worsened as global automakers target their core low-cost market with new economy models. Chinese automakers were stunned last year when GM unveiled a version of its Sail sedan priced at just 56,800 yuan ($9,100). GM says it also exported more than 60,000 Chinese-manufactured Sails last year to other developing markets.</content>

		<content>Washington's Scrap Dealers - NYTimes.com Article Tools Evelyn Hockstein for The New York Times By ERIC DASH WASHINGTON — JOE JIAMPIETRO and Jim Wigand are two of the busiest deal-makers around, calling on financial titans like Wilbur Ross and John Paulson, and orchestrating some of the biggest and most complex transactions in banking. Their pay? Each earned less than $260,000 last year. Their employer? The United States government. From their perch at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the two senior officials are responsible for sorting through the carnage of the financial crisis and finding buyers for the deposits, branches and loans of more than 200 failed banks. Between them, Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro have sold more than $508 billion in assets over the last two years, from financial giants like Washington Mutual and Corus Bankshares to little-noticed community lenders. They have reeled in new investors with innovative transactions. One October night, they announced they had found a buyer for nine failed banks. “Just take a look at the deal tables,” Mr. Jiampietro boasted, half-jokingly. “We would have 100 percent market share.” Special Section Wall Street’s Makeover DealBook’s spring 2010 special section delves into Wall Street’s efforts to reshape its image in the wake of widespread public anger. Read More » By several measures, Mr. Jiampietro and Mr. Wigand seem to have performed well for the government — although it could take years to see how their transactions work out. They have done this by acting like bankers, not bureaucrats, in negotiating deals meant to protect the savings of depositors and get the financial system back on its feet. “You don’t want inexperienced rookies in there up against the professionals on the other side,” said one senior federal official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named because he regularly interacts with banks. Wall Street does not mistake them for amateurs, either, although some of their deals have caused investors to grumble. Bond investors have lashed out at the structure of the Washington Mutual deal, which penalized them but protected the F.D.I.C.’s insurance fund from a potentially devastating loss. Some federal watchdogs say the government has offered too many sweetheart terms to potential buyers. And some private equity firms complained that the agency’s rules limited their ability to compete in auctions with traditional bank bidders. One thing is not in doubt: Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro are likely to stay busy for some time. Hundreds of small and midsize banks are expected to collapse in the coming years, putting enormous pressure on the F.D.I.C. deal team to find buyers or investors. Most people do not think of marathon deal-making as typical government work. But Mr. Wigand, 53, and Mr. Jiampietro, 44, aren’t your typical government employees. Mr. Wigand, a career civil servant with a technocratic bent befitting the son of a NASA engineer, has worked on failed bank transactions for more than two decades. He helped write the F.D.I.C. field manual on such deals, based on his experience selling assets during the savings and loan crisis. Now, as the agency’s deputy director for bank resolutions, Mr. Wigand is applying those lessons to today’s environment. Mr. Jiampietro, an investment banker and a lawyer, has drawn on previous experience in Washington and on Wall Street in his role as a top adviser to the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair. A former aide to the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Jiampietro spent more than a decade advising financial firms on mergers and other complex transactions. (He has also kept a toe in politics, donating money to the Obama campaign and to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a childhood friend.) To join the F.D.I.C., in March 2009, he took himself out of consideration for a senior Treasury Department post. Together, from a government building just blocks from the White House, Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro work with a core group of a dozen senior managers and sometimes as many as 200 federal employees, whom they are quick to credit for any success. They also rely on a coterie of outside firms, including Perella Weinberg Partners and others, that help them value and manage the assets of failed banks. But they approach the job as if they were co-heads of the government’s own financial institutions group. They eschew Washington’s alphabet-soup acronyms in favor of jargon like “doughnut structures,” “true-ups” and “equity kickers.” And like their Wall Street colleagues, they shroud their deal-making plans under the cover of code names. (The sale of Washington Mutual was known as Project Orca, while the one for BankUnited of Florida was called Project Beach.) Mr. Wigand specializes in structuring transactions and overseeing the deal team’s daily operations. Mr. Jiampietro serves as the F.D.I.C.’s eyes and ears in the markets, and advises on the biggest and most complex deals. He regularly meets with bank executives, hedge fund managers and other big investors to get their feedback on deal terms and other agency policies. Advisers who sit on the other side of the negotiating table say the two are open-minded, pragmatic and tough. “They listen; they probe,” said H. Rodgin Cohen, a top bank lawyer at Sullivan and Cromwell. “They will try to spend the time to think through ideas that you have.” Of course, there are differences between deal-making in the private and public sectors. Most investment bankers spend years courting clients to win advisory work. F.D.I.C. officials do not have to solicit new business: their assignments arise as regulators prepare a takeover of a troubled bank. They are only sellers — with a mandate to minimize losses. (“The business comes to us,” Mr. Wigand noted.) And even though Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro are among the country’s highest-paid government officials, they each earn less annually than Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, makes in a week. The government deal-makers also play by stricter rules. For example, they must offer the same terms to all prospective bidders, while their colleagues in the private sector can fine-tune a deal to satisfy a specific buyer. By law, they must choose the offer that is “least costly” to the F.D.I.C. fund. And forget about private jets, commemorative deal toys or lavish closing dinners. “Wall Street is all about the money,” said John Douglas, a bank specialist at the law firm Davis Polk and Wardwell and a former F.D.I.C. legal chief. “In Washington, you also have to worry about Congressional reaction, public reaction, what it looks like on the front page or when the inspector general comes in.” Over the last two years, the two men have come under ever-rising pressure. Middle-of-the-night board meetings grew so frequent that Mr. Wigand said he had lost track of how many he had participated in. Last summer proved so frantic, Mr. Jiampietro said, that he and Mr. Wigand resorted to holding a planning session on the Amtrak Acela train en route to New York. Sitting at a fold-out table with two deputies, they worked out the complex deal for Corus, a deeply troubled construction lender, that they referred to only as Project Cork. “When we got to Penn Station, all the fundamentals were established,” Mr. Wigand recalled. As fears of bank runs mounted, deal talks that once took months to negotiate were compressed into days. In the case of Colonial Bank, a $25 billion Southeastern regional lender that failed in August, the F.D.I.C. staged an auction just over a week after the disclosure of fraud involving its biggest borrower. Stunned by the news on a Wednesday, Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro immediately began putting out feelers to several banks that had previously expressed an interest in Colonial. Over the weekend, staff members in Washington and Dallas pulled together a term sheet and other documents for prospective buyers to review. By Monday, the group headed to New York to make a face-to-face pitch to several prospective buyers. Working long hours, they ultimately settled on a bid from the BBandT Corporation of North Carolina that would cost the insurance fund about $2.8 billion. BBandT’s takeover of Colonial was a signature deal for the F.D.I.C. It is among the 124 deals so far that involved a loss-sharing arrangement, a tool Mr. Wigand dusted off from the savings and loan crisis, in which the government agreed to take some of the pain if a buyer incurred losses from a target’s loans. Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro contend that the arrangement helps raise prices and eases the burden of managing billions of dollars of troubled assets, ultimately saving the insurance fund money. Critics say the terms are too generous to buyers, because the government is responsible for the bulk of the losses. Recently, as bidding has picked up, the agency has scaled back its most buyer-friendly arrangements. “One of the lessons of the last crisis is that you have to adapt to the market and be nimble,” Mr. Wigand said. “It’s not one size fits all.” Their team has adjusted in other ways, as well. After East West Bancorp of California participated in an F.D.I.C.-assisted deal last fall, several top officials noticed that its stock price soared. “A lot of that value creation is coming from us,” Mr. Jiampietro recalled the officials saying. “Shouldn’t the F.D.I.C. get a part of it?” Now, in five recent deals, the agency has been able to get a piece of the upside by obtaining short-term securities like warrants issued by the acquirer. Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro are introducing other changes, too. They began offering government-guaranteed financing to entice private investors to take some of the most troubled loans from failed banks off the agency’s hands. And as early as this summer, they may start packaging loans from multiple failed banks to create complex mortgage bonds — using the same type of financial alchemy that contributed to the financial crisis to clean up the mess. “You always hear that people in the government don’t work very hard,” Daryl Bible, BBandT’s chief financial officer, said. “That’s not these guys.” Go to DealBook’s Spring 2010 Special Section »</content>

		<content>Apple and the Debt Market - NYTimes.com Apple may need to make its i.o.u.’s as desirable as iPhones. Right now, money managers are gaga for the company’s bonds even before they have made their market debut. But the scale of issuance that could come from Apple is on a par with huge borrowers like banks. To be sustainable, that would call for some of Apple’s magic. Breakingviews View all posts Article Tools Debt from cash-rich American technology companies used to be exceedingly rare. But low interest rates have changed that. Borrowing cheaply is a better financial bet than repatriating cash earned overseas and paying tax on it. Microsoft tested the waters in 2009 and has raised nearly $15 billion since then, according to Thomson Reuters data. But Apple could be looking to borrow more than that every year. The company recently expanded its budget for dividends and stock buybacks to $100 billion by the end of 2015. Assuming $45 billion of its cash pile is onshore – a figure consistent with what the company has said – and ignoring new inflows, that means borrowing $55 billion in less than three years, according to the research firm CreditSights, or nearly $20 billion a year. That would put Apple in the same issuance ballpark as large banks like Bank of America and Citigroup and other big financial firms. And many of those are mostly refinancing old debt. The iPhone maker would be asking more of investors since it would be looking for new money each time. Most companies would have to pay lenders a premium to borrow so much. Apple is different, and not just because fixed-income fund managers may want to feel like the cool kids for once. A company with lots of cash, even if it is trapped overseas, is a godsend for those who simply do not want to worry about default. Apple has garnered a AA-plus rating from Standard and Poor’s, one notch down from AAA. Microsoft, a rare top-rated company, will pay less than 2.5 percent interest on the $1 billion of 10-year bonds it sold on Thursday. If its bonds keep on marching to market, however, Apple’s novelty as a borrower will wear off and the company will need to keep investors engaged. Innovation could help. Just as the Apple visionary Steven P. Jobs seemingly knew what people wanted before they did, the company might be able to use its brand and perhaps innovative structures to create a category of bonds investors suddenly could not do without. If Apple manages it right, i.o.u.’s could be the next big thing. Agnes T. Crane is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.

		<content>John McAfee Plays Hide-and-Seek in Belize - NYTimes.com DANIEL GUERRERO promised during his campaign for mayor here to clean up San Pedro, the only town on this island, a 20-minute puddle jump from the mainland. But if he ever runs for re-election, don’t expect him to mention that vow. “This” is a full-blown international media frenzy and the kind of mess that no politician could have seen coming. It started on Nov. 11, the morning that Gregory Faull, a 52-year-old American, was found dead, lying face up in a pool of blood in his home. He had been shot in the head. His laptop and iPhone were missing. A 9-millimeter shell was found nearby. What happened next turned this from a local crime story to worldwide news: The police announced that a “person of interest” in the investigation was a neighbor, John McAfee, a Silicon Valley legend who years ago earned millions from the computer virus-fighting software company that still bears his name. A priapic 67-year-old, with an improbable mop of blond-highlighted hair and a rotating group of young girlfriends, Mr. McAfee quickly melted into the island’s lush green forest. Then, for Belizean authorities, the real embarrassment began. with audio links, a comments section, photographs and a stream of invective against the government and the police of Belize. He has done interviews on podcasts, like the “Joe Rogan Experience,” and offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of “the person or persons” who killed Mr. Faull. He has turned lamming it into a kind of high-tech performance art. “I am asking all people of conscience to read this blog, especially the links in the ‘Background’ section,’ and see the ugly truth unfolding here,” he posted on Nov. 18. “Speak out. Write your congressmen. Write the prime minister. Do what you can.” Before he went underground, Mr. McAfee led a noisy, opulent and increasingly stressful life here. He was known for the retinue of prostitutes who he says moved in and out of his house, and for employing armed guards, some of whom stood watch on the beach abutting his house. He also kept a pack of untethered dogs on his property who barked at and sometimes bit passers-by. Two days before the murder, someone had poisoned a handful of those dogs. As it happens, Mr. Faull had complained about the animals, as well as the guards and the constant late-night inflow and outflow of taxis on the dirt path that runs behind his and Mr. McAfee’s homes — a path so tiny that it’s supposed to be off-limits to cars. Mr. Faull had shown up at the town council office a few weeks ago with a letter decrying the din and the dogs, as well as Mr. McAfee’s guns and behavior. Nothing came of it. “We were planning to meet with John McAfee and hand him the letter,” Mr. Guerrero said. “But it never happened. We were busy doing other work.” In hindsight, that looks like a blunder. Mr. McAfee has since said on his blog that he had no choice but to flee because police and politicians in Belize are corrupt and eager to kill him. As proof, he has written at length about a late April raid that the country’s Gang Suppression Unit conducted at a property of his on the mainland, in a district called Orange Walk. Some McAfee watchers have a different theory — namely, that he grew paranoid and perhaps psychotic after months of experimenting with and consuming MDPV, a psychoactive drug. These experiments were described in detail by Mr. McAfee himself, under the pseudonym “Stuffmonger” in a forum on Bluelight, a Web site popular with drug hobbyists. So, here’s one hypothesis: Rich man doses himself to madness while seeking sexual bliss through pharmacology. Then shoots neighbor in a rage. Case closed, right? Ah, but those Bluelight posts were a ruse, Mr. McAfee would later blog, just one of the many pranks he has perpetrated over the years — part of a bet with a friend to see if he could create Bluelight’s largest-ever thread. A picture caption last Sunday with an article about the founder of a Silicon Valley virus-fighting software company who was sought by the police in Belize in connection with a homicide investigation misspelled his surname. He is John McAfee, not McAfree.</content>

		<content>Dow Closes Rohm Deal and Sells Morton Salt - NYTimes.com Article Tools Having completed its $16.5 billion buyout of Rohm and Haas, Dow Chemical said Wednesday it would sell Morton Salt to a German fertilizer maker, K+S, in a deal valuing the former Rohm and Haas unit at $1.675 billion. The sale is part of Dow’s plan to sell off noncore Rohm and Haas assets to pay down the hefty debt it had to take on to complete the purchase of the chemical maker, after a Kuwaiti company’s cancellation of a planned joint venture deprived Dow of billions it had planned to use to buy Rohm and Haas, The Associated Press said. ”We are pleased that we reached an agreement with K+S at an attractive value in such a short period of time,” Dow’s chairman and chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris, said in a statement. ”This sale puts us ahead of schedule on our deleveraging plan post the close of the Rohm and Haas acquisition.” Dow said the Morton Salt divestiture is expected to close in mid-2009. The company said that the sale, together with prior actions like slashing its dividend and negotiating better terms on its bridge loan, will trim Dow’s bridge loan debt to about $7.5 billion from $13 billion. Dow said it had almost replaced the $7.5 billion cash shortfall created by the failure of its Kuwaiti joint venture transaction to close. K+S, based in Kassel, Germany, makes fertilizers, as well as plant care and salt products. Its salt segment makes food-grade salt as well as products for industrial and chemical use and for road de-icing. The sale was announced the same day that Dow closed on its deal to buy Rohm and Haas. Rohm and Haas will form the core of a new advanced materials unit that is expected to have $14 billion in annual sales, Dow, based in Midland, Mich., said. The Rohm and Haas brand will disappear and its stock will cease trading on Wednesday, Dow said. ”The closing of this transaction strongly positions Dow for the future by transforming our business portfolio,” Mr. Liveris said. ”We are committed to delivering on a clear and measurable plan designed to meet the needs of our investors, employees, customers and suppliers, even in this current challenging macroeconomic environment.” Dow’s executives have ”got a lot of work ahead of them,” a Gabelli and Company analyst, Robert Felice, told The Associated Press. Dow took on much more debt than originally planned for the Philadelphia-based company, a negative on Wall Street amid the financial downturn. Additionally, much of the funding for the deal came from a $10 billion loan that becomes much more expensive after a year. A successful integration is necessary to increase sales and reduce that burden, Gabelli said. Meanwhile, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services cut its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt rating on Dow to ”BBB-” from ”BBB.” The new rating is one notch above junk status, and a downgrade to that level could increase the company’s costs to borrow money. S.andP. kept Dow on CreditWatch with negative implications, implying another downgrade is possible. ”We believe the transaction is an important strategic initiative for Dow and consistent with its efforts to bolster the breadth of its specialty product offerings, but it will meaningfully stretch the financial profile to a level beyond what we consider consistent with the former ratings,” an S.andP. analyst, Kyle Loughlin, said in a statement. Dow first proposed the deal last July as part of a plan to focus on specialty chemicals and spin off its commodities business in a joint venture with a Kuwaiti company. The Kuwaiti company, however, pulled out of the joint venture late last year, denying Dow more than $5 billion in cash it had expected to use to buy Rohm and Haas. Dow then tried to delay the deal, a decision that led Rohm and Haas to sue in a Delaware court. Both companies settled just before the trial was set to start last month.

		<content>Analysis - BP's Legal Gamble May Trim Spill Bill by Billions - NYTimes.com NEW ORLEANS/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - BP Plc's attempt to get a U.S. federal court to pin at least a sizeable amount of the blame for the Deepwater Horizon disaster on other companies may have saved it billions of dollars. company opted in February to go to trial with plaintiffs ranging from small businesses to the U.S. government over the damages it will face. The decision rests with U.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier, who could issue findings on blame and the level of negligence as early as July. Legal experts say BP appeared to succeed in shifting some of the blame for the disaster to rig owner Transocean Ltd and cement provider Halliburton Co. In doing so, it may have shaved a slice off a liability that could stretch into the tens of billions of dollars. BP "put their faith in the hands of the court," said Blaine LeCesne, a tort law professor at Loyola University in New Orleans who has followed the trial closely. "It looks like that might have paid off." Of course, if Barbier determines that BP was grossly negligent then it could more than offset anything it has saved by getting the rap for the disaster shared more broadly. LeCesne, and two other legal experts who followed the trial but spoke privately on the matter, believed BP had some success in offloading blame for the worst U.S. offshore spill, which was caused by a blowout on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 people exactly three years ago on Saturday. During the trial last Wednesday, Transocean may have taken a hit from BP's final witness, Andrew Mitchell, a 40-year veteran of the offshore oil industry and now an International Safety Management Code consultant. Mitchell described the rig captain's response to the crisis as "completely inadequate." That came on top of Transocean's previous admission that its employees misinterpreted a crucial pressure test on the well and evidence that a dead battery in the blow-out preventer kept the device from closing the well hole. Transocean declined to comment on specifics of the trial, but said it remained confident in the case it presented. Halliburton also took some blows. Last month the company belatedly introduced cement samples into evidence. Then this month, Halliburton produced documents, including test results BP lawyer Mike Brock said he would have liked to have had while Halliburton witnesses were still on the stand. Another document included an email in which a Halliburton executive said their company was one of the "contributing parties" responsible for ensuring a sound cement job. "It's very troubling the way Halliburton has handled this entire matter," Judge Barbier said of the documents, adding that he was considering whether to impose sanctions in response. Testimony in the first phase of the trial ended April 17. With an estimated 70 million pages of evidence to weigh, the parties have 80 days to file legal briefs as Barbier considers blame and negligence in the non-jury trial. Phase two would determine exactly how much oil spilled so damages can be assessed, a process due to start in September. Legal sources say it is possible Barbier could delay announcing his phase-one trial conclusions until after the next phase, so total fines and penalties may not be known until 2014. LeCesne expects BP could shoulder about 70 percent of the blame and that Halliburton might bear a heavier share of the rest due to testimony regarding the failure of its cement mixture in attempts to plug the well. "I'd say Halliburton is likely to have an equal or higher percentage attributed to it than Transocean," LeCesne said. BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said the evidence presented at the trial showed BP was not grossly negligent and the accident was the result of "multiple causes, involving multiple parties."</content>

		<content>Look to Japan's Ageing Industrial Sprawl for Roadblock to Abenomics - NYTimes.com But the yen's rise over the following five years to a record high of 75 yen to the dollar in October 2011, raised doubts about the economics of the investment decisions and prompted a scramble to try to move production overseas. Reflecting the pressures on Japanese manufacturers, spare production capacity at carmakers is expected to grow in the years ahead. IHS Automotive forecasts that carmakers' 2012 capacity utilisation in Japan of 84 percent will fall to 80 percent in 2013 and to 76 percent in 2018. In 2005, the industry had been using 90 percent of its capacity in Japan. The only positive sign for new investment now, economists say, is that many companies need to invest to update outdated production equipment even if they keep output steady. "Manufacturers may not increase production capacity. But equipment is getting old, so it is going to be necessary to make changes," said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. Even so, manufacturers are unlikely to fundamentally increase production capacity at home because demand in Japan -- where population peaked in 2008 -- is unlikely to grow in the long run. Toyota, for one, has said it has frozen plans to build any new plants in Japan or overseas in the next three years. The automaker, which battled to keep capacity in Japan during the yen's surge, has no plans to expand its domestic output. However, it does plan to expand output abroad, announcing on Friday that it would increase production at its existing U.S. Kentucky factory by 10 percent. "It will take a great deal of time and effort to bring back what has left Japan. The yen, which stayed below 80 against the dollar for too long, has hurt the automotive industry more so than people imagine," Toyota President Akio Toyoda said in February.

		<content>Calpers Forges Ahead With Board Campaigns - NYTimes.com Article Tools Calpers, the largest American pension fund, said Wednesday that it was stepping up a campaign to make corporate management more accountable to shareholders as it takes its Majority Vote Initiative into the new year. The initiative, which advocates a policy of electing board candidates for uncontested seats by a majority vote, rather than a simple plurality (which may be no more than one vote), was made with 58 companies, of which 20 have adopted the measure already. “The proposed majority vote policy backed by Calpers would require the resignation of any director who receives a withhold vote greater than 50 percent of the votes cast,” Calpers said. The pension fund said it planned to file shareowner proposals with Annaly Capital Management, Apple, BBandT and the V.F. Corporation — four companies that did not respond to its initial call. “Currently, a plurality vote system is used in most corporate elections, in which directors can be elected by the vote of a single share unless they are opposed by a dissident candidate,” Calpers has said. In August, the Securities and Exchange Commission introduced new proxy access rules making it easier for shareholders to nominate candidates to corporate boards — a move that has been hotly contested in the business world.</content>

		<content>JPMorgan Caught in Swirl of Regulatory Woes - NYTimes.com Karen Bleier/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesJamie Dimon, chief of JPMorgan Chase, spoke to a Senate panel last year. Government investigators have found that JPMorgan Chase devised “manipulative schemes” that transformed “money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers,” and that one of its most senior executives gave “false and misleading statements” under oath. The findings appear in a confidential government document, reviewed by The New York Times, that was sent to the bank in March, warning of a potential crackdown by the regulator of the nation’s energy markets. The possible action comes amid showdowns with other agencies. One of the bank’s chief regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is weighing new enforcement actions against JPMorgan over the way the bank collected credit card debt and its possible failure to alert authorities to suspicions about Bernard L. Madoff, according to people who were not authorized to discuss the cases publicly. Article Tools In a meeting last month at the bank’s Park Avenue headquarters, the comptroller’s office delivered an unusually stark message to Jamie Dimon, the chief executive and chairman: the nation’s biggest bank was quickly losing credibility in Washington. The bank’s top lawyers, including Stephen M. Cutler, the general counsel, have also cautioned executives about the bank’s regulatory problems, employees say. Mr. Dimon acknowledged in a recent letter to shareholders that “unfortunately, we expect we will have more” enforcement actions in “the coming months.” He apologized for letting “our regulators down” and vowed to “do all the work necessary to complete the needed improvements.” Still, the broad regulatory scrutiny — at least eight federal agencies are investigating the bank — presents a threat to JPMorgan at a time when it is raking in record profits. For executives, the bank’s transition from model citizen to problem child in the eyes of the government has been jarring. It has helped drive top managers out of the bank, and it could make a coming shareholder vote on whether to split the roles of chairman and chief executive an anxious test for Mr. Dimon, long the country’s most influential banker. Given the bank’s strong earnings, investors are unlikely to pull out. Yet a growing number of shareholders say they are concerned about the regulatory problems. In the energy market investigation, the enforcement staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, intends to recommend that the agency pursue an action against JPMorgan over its trading in California and Michigan electric markets. The 70-page document also took aim at a top bank executive, Blythe Masters. A seminal Wall Street figure, Ms. Masters is known for helping expand the boundaries of finance, including the development of credit default swaps, a derivative that played a role in the financial crisis. The regulatory document cites her supposed “knowledge and approval of schemes” carried out by a group of energy traders in Houston. The agency’s investigators claimed that Ms. Masters had “falsely” denied under oath her awareness of the problems and said that JPMorgan had made “scores of false and misleading statements and material omissions” to authorities, the document shows. It is unclear whether the agency will file an action against JPMorgan based on the investigators’ findings. A majority of the five-member commission must first endorse the case. If the regulator does proceed, it could fine the bank and Ms. Masters. “We intend to vigorously defend the firm and the employees in this matter,” said Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the bank. “We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter.” JPMorgan has until at least mid-May to respond to the accusations in the document. As the bank fights the energy investigation, it says it is trying to rectify other lingering compliance woes. Recent departures from the bank, however, could complicate that effort. Frank J. Bisignano, the co-chief operating officer known for cleaning up JPMorgan’s troubled mortgage division after the 2008 financial crisis, announced his departure this week. Barry Koch, a senior lawyer with strong ties to law enforcement, is also expected to soon leave the bank, people close to Mr. Koch say. Mr. Dimon’s meeting with the comptroller’s office last month further highlighted the bank’s challenges with regulators. In the credit card investigation, people briefed on the case said the comptroller’s office had discovered that JPMorgan was relying on faulty documents when pursuing lawsuits against delinquent customers. The accusations, which are expected to prompt an enforcement action later this year, echo complaints that JPMorgan and rivals plowed through home foreclosures with little regard for accuracy. In a separate investigation into JPMorgan’s relationship with Mr. Madoff, the comptroller’s office raised concerns that the company may have violated a federal law that requires banks to report suspicious transactions. Eventually, the people said, the agency could reprimand the bank for the potential oversight failures. “We believe that the personnel who dealt with the Madoff issue acted in good faith,” Ms. Lemkau, the bank spokeswoman, said. Some bank analysts also note that JPMorgan’s strong earnings could ameliorate concerns among its investors. “As long as you’re making money, investors don’t care,” said Paul Miller, a managing director at FBR. Regulators, however, increasingly do care. When the comptroller’s office sought documents in the Madoff case from JPMorgan, the bank declined, citing attorney-client privilege, according to bank employees. The dispute was then elevated to the Treasury Department’s inspector general, which oversees the comptroller’s office. “The matter is pending,” said Richard Delmar, a counsel to the inspector general. The Madoff case, authorities say, exposed a recurring problem at JPMorgan — what they say is its sometimes combative stance with regulators. In a recent report examining a $6 billion trading loss at the bank, Senate investigators faulted JPMorgan for briefly withholding documents from regulators. The trading loss has spawned several law enforcement investigations into the traders who created the faulty wager. Mr. Dimon, who is not suspected of any wrongdoing, met this week with prosecutors and the F.B.I. to discuss the case, two people briefed on the investigation said. A day before the Senate subcommittee released its report on the trading loss, JPMorgan received another ominous dispatch from Washington. On March 13, enforcement officials at FERC notified the bank that it planned to recommend an action over the power plant investigation. JPMorgan is the latest big bank to face scrutiny from the energy regulator, which recently pursued actions against Barclays and Deutsche Bank. The cases reflect how the regulator has kept a more vigilant watch over the energy markets ever since the Enron fraud. But Wall Street is fighting back against the new approach, casting the agency’s enforcement unit as overzealous and overreaching. The JPMorgan case arose, according to the document, after the bank’s 2008 takeover of Bear Stearns gave the bank the rights to sell electricity from power plants in California and Michigan. It was a losing business that relied on “inefficient” and outdated technology, or as JPMorgan called it, “an unprofitable asset.” Yet under “pressure to generate large profits,” the agency’s investigators said, traders in Houston devised a workaround. Adopting eight different “schemes” between September 2010 and June 2011, the traders offered the energy at prices “calculated to falsely appear attractive” to state energy authorities. The effort prompted authorities in California and Michigan to dole out about $83 million in “excessive” payments to JPMorgan, the investigators said. The behavior had “harmful effects” on the markets, according to the document. JPMorgan disputes the claims, arguing that its trading was legal. “The staff is challenging a bidding strategy that was transparent and was in full compliance with the applicable rules,” said Ms. Lemkau, the bank’s spokeswoman. “We strongly disagree with the staff’s conclusions.” For now, according to the document, the enforcement officials plan to recommend that the commission hold the traders and Ms. Masters “individually liable.” While Ms. Masters was “less involved in the day-to-day decisions,” investigators nonetheless noted that she received PowerPoint presentations and e-mails outlining the energy trading strategies. The bank, investigators said, then “planned and executed a systematic cover-up” of documents that exposed the strategy, including profit and loss statements. In the March document, the government investigators also complained about what they said was obstruction by Ms. Masters. After the state authorities began to object to the strategy, Ms. Masters “personally participated in JPMorgan’s efforts to block” the state authorities “from understanding the reasons behind JPMorgan’s bidding schemes,” the document said. The investigators also referenced an April 2011 e-mail in which Ms. Masters ordered a “rewrite” of an internal document that raised questions about whether the bank had run afoul of the law. The new wording stated that “JPMorgan does not believe that it violated FERC’s policies.” A version of this article appeared in print on 05/03/2013, on page A1 of the NewYork edition with the headline: JPMorgan Caught in Swirl of Regulatory Woes.</content>

		<content>Fathers Seek Advertising That Does Not Ridicule - NYTimes.com Advertisers and brands have been slow to respond to fathers as a consumer group because of a dearth of data, says Alan Kercinik, a Chicago-based group creative director at Edelman, the public relations firm. “There is considerably more time, attention and money spent understanding how ‘she’ buys versus how ‘families’ buy — and certainly more than ‘he’ buys,” Mr. Kercinik says. “We are just at the hello stage on this journey to reach dads,” says Barry Calpino, vice president for breakthrough innovation at the Kraft Foods Group. “Ninety-nine percent of the conversation is ‘she,’ ” he says. “I haven’t been to a food retailer who didn’t refer to the shopper as ‘she,’ so I don’t think we are even thinking about metrics at this point.” That is changing, albeit slowly. Recently, Dove Men+Care commissioned research, in conjunction with the “Any subject related to dads, we want to know about,” says Rob Candelino, vice president for marketing at Unilever, who focuses on the Dove Men +Care product line. This is not a social mission; it is about the bottom line. Dove Men+Care, introduced in 2010, is already a $100 million brand, and about 75 percent of its customers are fathers, according to Mr. Candelino, who is a father himself. “Men are more receptive to messages about taking care of themselves after they have children,” he says. In the past, advertisers paid more attention to men in the so-called laddie demographic, ages 18 to 30, who are more likely to spend their disposable income on alcohol and cars. But there is a whole group of men between the beer-guzzling, Maxim-reading phase and the Viagra years. Mr. Candelino described his target customer as a father, or an expectant one, who is in his late 30s and married, cares deeply about his role as a father and mentor, and is as comfortable having a tea party with his daughter as he is having beers with his friends. “No brands were talking to guys at that level,” he says. “Society is ready for a new narrative about dads.”</content>

		<content>Japan Orders AIJ Investment Advisors to Suspend Operations - NYTimes.com TOKYO — Japanese financial authorities suspended the operations of a money management firm on Friday after it was unable to account for the bulk of $2.6 billion in pension funds it managed for its clients. AIJ Investment Advisors was until recently the darling of Japanese fund managers, topping an industry ranking for years and bringing in robust returns even through the global financial crisis. But now the firm is unable to explain its finances to investors, the Financial Services Agency said on Friday. It ordered the Tokyo-based company, which managed about 210 billion yen ($2.62 billion) worth of pension funds for 123 clients at the end of its fiscal year in March, to halt operations for a month to await results of further investigations. The suspension comes on the heels of a $1.7 billion accounting scandal at the Japanese camera maker Olympus, which has raised questions about the prevalence of white-collar crime in Japan and the ability of Japanese financial regulators to monitor offenders. It was unclear whether investigators suspected that AIJ had racked up huge losses on investments gone sour or that it had channeled client money into a . The Nikkei business daily reported that AIJ had provided clients with fraudulent reports to mask its losses. At a news conference in Tokyo, Shozaburo Jimi, the financial services minister, said he had ordered a sweeping investigation into the finances of 260 other money management companies in Japan. “That things have come to this is deplorable,” Mr. Jimi said. Financial oversight could need to be strengthened, he added. AIJ could not immediately be reached for comment, nor could Sei Takahashi, the lawyer representing the firm. Yaskawa Electric told The Yomiuri, Japan’s largest daily newspaper, that just 2 percent of its pension funds were managed by AIJ and that there would be little fallout. AIJ had long been lauded in Japan for its high returns. In 2011, the company was picked the best Japan-based active pension fund for the fifth consecutive year in an industry ranking by Rating and Investment Information, a Tokyo-based research company. to log returns on the pension funds it managed of more than 8 percent in 2007, and more than 7 percent in 2008 — years when most other Japanese pension funds bled money. But AIJ’s “track record of information disclosure does not receive high marks,” it noted in its 2008 assessment. The emerging situation at AIJ shares many characteristics with the Olympus scheme. AIJ is run by a former banker of Japan’s largest securities firm, Nomura, which experienced an exodus in the late 1990s after a scandal involving payoffs to corporate racketeers. Two central figures in the Olympus accounting fraud were also former Nomura bankers. Kazuhiko Asakawa, who took over AIJ in 2001, and Nobumasa Yokoo, who is accused of helping Olympus cover up its losses, were at Nomura together though much of the 1990s, according to the announcements. An AIJ board member, Shimpei Matsuki, was one of three Nomura executives convicted of illegally compensating a mobster-linked racketeer with more than 370 million yen ($4.6 million). Mr. Matsuki received a suspended sentence in 1999. Meanwhile, Finance Ministry records also show that a company at the center of the Olympus scandal, Axes Japan, and a company closely linked to AIJ, called ITM Securities, obtained licenses to offer financial services within six months of each other after Japan’s “Big Bang” financial liberalization push in 1998. Axes Japan played a central role in setting up a scheme that allowed Olympus to keep losses off its books for decades, later settling them in transactions disguised as payments for mergers and acquisitions. AIJ is suspected of channeling client money through ITM Securities to investment funds based in the Cayman Islands, according to the Nikkei business daily. The Olympus loss cover-up scheme also involved funds incorporated in the Cayman Islands, a top offshore financial center. ITM, which is based in the same building as AIJ, was embroiled in a stock manipulation scandal in 2005 and heavily reprimanded by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. ITM could not be reached for comment. An article on Saturday about the government-ordered suspension of operations at ALJ Investment Advisors, a Japanese money management firm, misstated the given name of one of its executives. He is Kazuhiko Asakawa, not Kazuhiro.</content>

		<content>An S.E.C. Settlement, Challenged, Is Approved - NYTimes.com last year over the adequacy of a proposed fraud settlement approved the deal this week without requiring substantial changes. , a Milwaukee maker of stereo headphones, with preparing “materially inaccurate financial statements” from 2005 through 2009, raised some of the same questions posed last year by Judge In December, the Wisconsin judge, Rudolph T. Randa of the state’s Eastern District, asked the commission to explain why the proposed settlement with Koss was “fair, adequate and in the public interest.” He said that some of the provisions were “vague and could pose enforcement issues in the future.” The commission defended its proposed terms but agreed to redraft its settlement to more explicitly spell out all of the remedial actions required of Koss. “The S.E.C.’s response largely satisfied the court’s concerns,” Judge Randa wrote in a letter dated Feb. 1, adding that he would not withhold his approval of the settlement. The commission has been under fire since Judge Rakoff rejected its proposed settlement with Citigroup over misleading statements that the agency said the bank made in 2007 regarding a mortgage-backed security. Judge Rakoff said the settlement was not fair, adequate or in the public interest because it contained no proven or admitted facts upon which to judge its worthiness. The commission has appealed that action and is awaiting a response from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judge Randa of Wisconsin appeared to be the first federal district judge to cite Judge Rakoff’s action in the Citigroup case. Legal experts say that if Judge Rakoff is successful in requiring commission settlements to specify proven or admitted facts, companies will be less likely to settle because it would open them to liability in shareholder lawsuits. If forced to admit wrongdoing, companies would be more likely to demand a trial in S.E.C. fraud cases, the agency says. But the resources required to take cases to court are so large, the agency says, that it would mean that it would be able to pursue fewer enforcement actions each year.</content>

		<content>Why It's Not Easy to Freeze Your Child's Credit File - NYTimes.com In her job as an analyst specializing in the retail banking world, Julie McNelley talks to a lot of bank executives. Recently, she says, she has heard concerns about child identity theft involving the use of a minor’s Social Security number to commit financial fraud. How serious a risk is child identity fraud? The Federal Trade Commission recently cited a report from ID Analytics, an identity-theft prevention firm, estimating that 140,000 minors may be at risk each year. (For perspective, there are 73 million Americans under age 18, according to the latest Census.) Sometimes the perpetrator isn’t a stranger but a strapped family member in need of fresh credit. A report this spring from CyLab, a research center at Carnegie Mellon University, said an analysis of 43,000 children registered with a commercial identity protection service found that 10 percent of them had someone else using their Social Security number. But the statistical significance of the finding in the general population is undetermined, the report said. Still, child identity theft can be particularly insidious because it may go undiscovered for years, until the child grows up and applies for credit. So Ms. McNelley, who is also a parent, decided to take the initiative and seek a security freeze in her young son’s name at the three major credit-reporting bureaus. (My colleague Ron Lieber wrote about credit freezes in a recent column.) She doesn’t have reason to believe his information is being misused, she said. “I’m choosing to err on the side of caution.” But Ms. McNelley, who blogged about her effort, found that she had trouble accomplishing her mission. In fact, according to the three major credit bureaus, it’s not really an option, unless a child is already a victim. A security freeze is a tool that can be used to shut access to an existing credit file, said Rod Griffin, director of public education for Experian, one of the major bureaus. Most children don’t have credit files — or at least, they shouldn’t. (The main exception is if a parent has added a teenager, say, as a cardholder on a credit card account; that may establish a file.) Generally, a file is created the first time an application is received for credit. So if a child’s Social Security number hasn’t been used on a credit application, there should be no file. And “if there isn’t one,” Mr. Griffin said, “there’s nothing to freeze.” Spokesmen for TransUnion and Equifax gave similar responses to a question about whether parents could freeze access to a child’s Social Security number. A security freeze, the TransUnion spokesman noted in an e-mail, “applies to a credit file, not a SSN.” So rather than starting out by asking for a freeze, parents may want to step back and consider if they have reason to suspect that their child’s information may be at risk. Gabby Beltran, a spokeswoman for Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit group, said it recommends that parents initiate an inquiry with the credit bureaus only if they suspect a problem. (Repeated inquiries, she says, may inadvertently create a semblance of a credit record, which is what you are trying to avoid.) Warning signals may include getting preapproved credit offers in your child’s name in the mail (although that can sometimes happen if you open a savings account in your child’s name, so you shouldn’t panic if that happens), or calls from collection agencies about accounts in your child’s name that you don’t know about. If you are worried, you can find information from Experian and Transunion on their Web sites about how to check if there is a credit file in your child’s name. (An Equifax spokesman said parents could contact the bureau regarding a minor child’s credit file at the following address:Equifax Inc., In care of minor child, P.O. Box 105139, Atlanta, Ga. 30348. The letter must state the child’s Social Security number and include a copy of the child’s birth certificate as well as the parent’s driver’s license or other identification.) Generally, when contacting the bureaus, you must send documentation via Postal Service mail to prove you are the parent or guardian of the child in question. (The Identity Theft Resource Center offers sample letters to send.) If there’s no file, there’s probably no problem. If there is a file, the bureau will send it to you. If you see evidence of fraud, you can request a fraud alert to flag potential creditors of the problem and take steps to correct the record. Mr. Griffin says Experian will agree to a freeze or fraud alert if there is a report and will work with the parent to remove fraudulent accounts. There are commercial services that offer to monitor your, or your child’s, Social Security number for potential misuse. A unit of Experian, for instance, offers the service for about $20 a month. Consultants say it makes sense to take care with your child’s Social Security number. You must provide it if establishing certain financial accounts, but it’s not usually mandatory in other cases. If it’s requested at your pediatrician’s office, or to register for school or for child athletic activities, ask why it’s being sought, how it’s used and how the information will be protected if you provide it. Ms. McNelley says she never provides her child’s Social Security number at a doctor’s office, and she has never been questioned about leaving that space blank on a form. She says she is waiting for a response to her written requests for a credit freeze for her son and will update her blog when she hears. Have you ever suspected misuse of your child’s Social Security number? What steps did you take?</content>

		<content>Exclusive - Bain, Golden Gate in the Lead to Buy BMC Software-Sources - NYTimes.com group made up of Bain Capital LLC and Golden Gate Capital Corp has emerged as the lead contender to buy BMC Software Inc for more than $6.5 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Bain and Golden Gate, which made a binding bid for the business software maker on April 22, offered more than a rival consortium of KKR and Co LP, TPG Capital LP and Thoma Bravo LLC, the sources said. The exact bids could not immediately be learned, but one of the sources said the offers came in a range of $45 to $50 per share, valuing the company at more than $6.5 billion. A deal for BMC Software would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts so far this year, after Michael Dell teamed up with private equity firm Silver Lake Partners LP to take Dell Inc private for $24.4 billion. Silver Lake accounts for only a quarter of the equity in that deal. Buoyant debt markets have encouraged private equity to consider larger deals, which in turn call for larger equity checks and make buyout firms more open to teaming up. BMC Software has not granted exclusivity to Bain and Golden Gate and the rival consortium could still raise its bid, or the business technology company may yet decide not to sell at all, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. BMC is trying to finalize an agreement in the coming week, one of the people added. BMC Software and KKR did not respond to requests for comment while TPG, Bain, Thoma Bravo and Golden Gate declined to comment. BMC Software shares ended trading at $45.58 on Tuesday, giving the company a value of $6.5 billion. It competes with Oracle Corp, SAP AG, CA Inc and Compuware Corp, and has been under pressure from Paul Singer's activist hedge fund Elliott Associates LP to sell itself since last year. Elliott, which has a 9.7 percent stake in the company, argued that BMC's management was neglecting a huge opportunity to expand into Internet-based business software, a market dominated by the likes of Salesforce.com Inc. The world's largest providers of software for enterprises, including Oracle, SAP and Microsoft Corp, have already begun investing heavily in that market. Houston, Texas-based BMC is due to announce first-quarter earnings on May 7. Its shares have rallied 14.7 percent since the start of the year, on expectations of a deal, compared with a 9.5 percent rise in the NASDAQ. BMC Software currently trades at 11.5 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with an 11.1 times average for its peer group, according to Thomson Reuters data. BMC said on April 8 that it would reduce its workforce following a company-wide operational review. Those job cuts will result in pretax charges of approximately $33 million to $38 million for severance and related termination costs, it added. Rival Compuware, which has rejected a $2.3 billion bid from Elliott, is also exploring a sale and talking to buyout firms to gauge takeover interest, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Elliott is a seasoned investor in the software sector. It is a shareholder in business software company Attachmate Corp, alongside Golden Gate, Thoma Bravo and Francisco Partners.</content>

		<content>Delish Magazine, Sold Only at Walmart, Performs Remarkably Well - NYTimes.com . So a new magazine, available only at Walmart, should rank right up there among what Twitter users call #epicfails, yes? , did well enough with its first issue in November, according to its publisher, Hearst Magazines, that it is being expanded this year to quarterly frequency. It will publish issues dated February, May, August and November. Delish’s performance was cited as a high point of last year in an annual review by Hearst Magazines’s parent company, the Hearst Corporation. David Carey, president of Hearst Magazines, mentioned Delish twice in a letter to employees , that Hearst operates with the MSN unit of Microsoft. (If some readers hear an echo, that is because PGOA Media, owned by Bain Capital Ventures, publishes a magazine about food called Relish, which is distributed with newspapers.) The food category is doing better than many others in publishing as marketers of packaged foods seek to reach budget-conscious consumers who are eating at home rather than dining out. Examples include Food Network Magazine, recently introduced by Hearst as a joint venture with Scripps Networks Interactive, The Meredith Corporation, which competes in the food category with magazines like Family Circle and Ladies’ Home Journal, has started a food Web site, In addition to being part of a trend, there may be another reason Delish is in demand: it is free to any Walmart shopper who buys one of six Hearst magazines — Country Living; Good Housekeeping; House Beautiful; O, the Oprah Magazine; Redbook; or Woman’s Day — at the regular single-copy price. Delish accompanies each magazine in a plastic wrapper festooned with the words “Free!” and “For Walmart shoppers!” Sales of the November issues of the six magazines with Delish piggybacked rose an average of 22 percent, said Michael A. Clinton, president for marketing and publishing director at Hearst Magazines in New York. “It’s part of a larger Hearst strategy we call pop-up edit,” Mr. Clinton said, using the industry shorthand for editorial content. “Across our portfolio, we’re looking for different ways to inject value for the reader.” Other examples he gave included sections of Food Network Magazine devoted to children, men and travel, and a 40-page supplement to the April issue of Cosmopolitan that will be devoted to “ The first issue of Delish was 48 pages, and the second was 32 pages. Subsequent issues will be 48 to 60 pages, Mr. Clinton said. The first two issues carried advertising pages from more than two dozen blue-chip marketers, including Campbell Soup, Del Monte, Johnson and Johnson, Kellogg, Kraft, McCormick, Nestlé, Procter and Gamble, J. M. Smucker and Unilever. Ads for Delish are being sold separately from ads for the six other magazines, said Carol E. Campbell, group strategic director for digital at Hearst Magazines. A typical ad page in Delish costs $18,000, she said, compared with $150,000 in Woman’s Day. About 510,000 copies of each issue of Delish are being printed; by comparison, the rate base, or circulation guaranteed to advertisers, for Woman’s Day is 3.25 million. Walmart makes sense as a home for Delish, Ms. Campbell said, not only because it is America’s largest seller of magazines but also because Walmart shoppers visit Also, said Elizabeth Shepard, general manager for food and home and digital media at Hearst Magazines, “Walmart has been one of the most active advertisers on Playing off the industry term “added value,” for something extra offered to consumers or advertisers, Ms. Shepard, who is also executive director and editor in chief of Delish, called the magazine “valuable value.” There is a precedent for a magazine that can be found solely in Walmart stores. Since 2004, the Time Inc. division of Time Warner has published All You, which covers food, fashion, crafts, home decorating and so-called smart shopping, or deal-hunting. All You began with a rate base of 500,000, which, after 10 increases in eight years, now stands at 1.5 million. With a cover price of $2.99, it sells the most single copies of any monthly magazine at Walmart. “I’m really proud of what All You has pioneered and accomplished” in reaching “mainstream American women,” said Suzanne Quint, publisher at All You in New York. “Back in 2004, people weren’t dying to talk to a value-conscious shopper who shops at Walmart,” she said. “It’s a whole different world today.” As Delish enters Walmart, All You is expanding beyond it. Starting with the June issue, Ms. Quint said, All You plans to “test distribution across several retailers” in addition to Walmart, which “will continue to be an important outlet for us.” (All You is also available by subscription.)</content>

		<content>Apple Stock Isn’t a Bellwether, Even if It’s Big - NYTimes.com Mr. Hickey says he isn’t sure what to make of the I.B.M.-market connection, either. I.B.M.’s role as a bellwether is plausible because it is such a well-established company and touches so many industries. But other companies that score highly as bellwethers don’t have a reach wide enough to look like natural leaders of the entire market, he says. After I.B.M., his statistics show that the next four companies, in descending order of influence, are Harmon International, the maker of audio and electronic systems; Altera, the semiconductor company; the Ball Corporation, which provides packaging for consumer products and aerospace technologies for commercial and governmental customers; and Cooper Tire and Rubber. Then again, being a bellwether is an informal designation, and in its original meaning, it wasn’t entirely positive. The word’s etymology makes that clear: a wether is a castrated male sheep, and a bellwether is one of those emasculated sheep with a bell hanging around its neck. Shepherds use bellwethers to lead other sheep around. Writers and market analysts use the word as a metaphor for a leader, and have done so for decades. Through the years, traders, analysts and journalists have designated many a market bellwether, including United States Steel, General Motors, ATandT, RCA, Chrysler, DuPont, the New York Central Railroad, Consolidated Edison, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Citigroup, General Electric and the 30-year Treasury bond. I.B.M. has been called a bellwether, on and off, since at least the 1970s. PROFESSOR MALKIEL agrees that Apple isn’t a bellwether, but he doubts that any company is. He says he believes in the wisdom of long-term, buy-and-hold investing in low-cost index funds and advises against seeking hidden market patterns caused by bellwethers or much anything else. Basing the market’s five-week direction on its one-day reaction to I.B.M. earnings is too simple to be plausible, he said. “If you search through data deeply enough you’ll find all kinds of connections,” he said. “But are they real? If you believe this one is, you can go out and bet your money on it. But I can tell you that I won’t be doing that.”</content>

		<content>3D Systems Revenue Jumps as It Sells More Printers - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Three-dimensional printer maker 3D Systems Corp reported a 31 percent jump in quarterly revenue as it benefited from robust spending on manufacturing and RandD. Shares in the company, whose peers include Stratasys Ltd and recently listed ExOne Co, were up about 3 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday. Revenue rose to $102.1 million in the first quarter as 3D Systems sold 81 percent more printers and gross margin expanded 250 basis points. Net income fell to $5.9 million, or 6 cents per share, from $6.2 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 21 cents per share. Analysts expected it to earn 21 cents per share on revenue of $101.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company expects to continue to benefit from spending in RandD and manufacturing despite economic uncertainties in some parts of the world, said Chief Executive Avi Reichental. The 3D printing industry, enjoying strong demand, is capable of growing by more than 20 percent annually for the "foreseeable future," Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen wrote in a pre-earnings note. 3D Systems is the biggest among listed companies which produce three-dimensional printers, a popular technology that U.S. President Barack Obama described as having "the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything," in his The company, however, has also faced criticism.

		<content>Japan Telecom Backed by Carlyle Files for Bankruptcy - NYTimes.com Article Tools The Japanese wireless company Willcom, 60 percent owned by the private equity firm Carlyle Group, said Thursday it was filing for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo, Chris V. Nicholson and Hiroko Tabuchi report in The New York Times. Willcom said it had liabilities of 206 billion yen, or $2.2 billion, as of December, and 5 billion yen in capital, and had been unable to reach an agreement on debt payments with its two main creditors, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group. In a statement, the company said it had faced “fierce competition in the mobile communications industry” as it attempted to keep up with larger rivals like NTT DoCoMo, KDDI and Softbank. The Tokyo-based company said that heavy investment in high speed data communications had overstretched its finances. Willcom said it was in talks to receive support from Softbank and Advantage Partners, a private equity firm, under a plan to spin off a part of the firm. The company is also seeking support from a government rescue agency, the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, Willcom said. Kyocera, the electronics company, holds a 30 percent stake in Willcom, and the telecommunications firm KDDI Corp. holds the remaining 10 percent. Carlyle and Kyocera bought their stakes from KDDI in 2004, when Willcom was still known as DDI Pocket, itself founded in 1994. Willcom is the main provider of PHS, or personal handy service, a relatively low-cost mobile network system created and mainly used in Japan. It is the next-generation PHS part of its business that may be spun off, the Nikkei financial newspaper reported. Willcom had 4.3 million subscribers as of January 2010, the company said, and it said Thursday that their service would not be affected by the bankruptcy filing. The company employs 1,058 people, it said. Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation, or E.T.I.C., is the same government agency that stepped in to help Japan Airlines last month as the troubled carrier attempts to restructure.

		<content>Time Warner Spin-Off Puts Spotlight Back on Content - NYTimes.com Article Tools In another era at Time Warner, before a star-crossed Internet merger, the hard-held belief of Gerald M. Levin, then the chief executive, was that “content is and will remain king, but distribution is the power behind the throne.” These days, The New York Times says, the king seems to be losing his throne. On Wednesday, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, who became chief executive in January, succeeding Richard D. Parsons, said that Time Warner would completely spin off its cable company, essentially shedding the pipes that have underpinned much of the company’s fortune. Although the announcement was largely anticipated by Wall Street – it had earlier spun off a 16 percent stake to shareholders – it still underscored a profound philosophical shift. For years, it was a widely held belief within Time Warner and the media business that there were real financial advantages to owning both the content – television shows and films – and the means of distributing it to people’s homes. But Wednesday’s cable announcement, which came as Time Warner reported first-quarter earnings, spotlighted the company’s future as a pure content provider. From now on the media company will revolve around two core content businesses that have been out of the limelight in recent years: the Warner Brothers movie studio and Turner Networks, which includes the television channels TNT, TBS, HBO and CNN. Although those divisions have produced steady revenue and cash flow, investors and the media have focused instead on the debate over cable and the drama unfolding (still) at AOL. Without the cable business, the bulk of Time Warner’s revenue will come from the movie studio and the cable networks. In the first quarter, Warner Brothers generated $2.84 billion, while the networks brought in $2.66 billion; the cable business that is being split off brought in $4.16 billion in revenue in the first quarter. “Over time, Warner Brothers has been a gold mine,” Larry Haverty, who runs the Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust fund, which owns 230,000 shares of Time Warner, told The Times. “And at the cable networks, they’ve done a great job. CNN has come back against Fox. And HBO is a juggernaut that is probably at a low ebb in terms of content.” Mr. Bewkes, in a conference call, pointed to several growth areas. TNT and TBS, for example, will focus more on original programming than on introducing new channels. Original shows can be particularly valuable in the long run because the company owns the copyrights; some of Turner’s existing ones are “The Closer” and “Tyler Perry’s House of Payne.” “While some network groups have invested in niche networks, we funneled our resources primarily into expanding our big-reach existing brands,” Mr. Bewkes said. He signaled that Time Warner would compete more directly with the broadcast networks for viewers and advertising dollars. “We believe Turner is now positioned better than ever to challenge the broadcast networks,” he said. On Wednesday, Time Warner reported net income of $771 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or 31 cents a share, in the period a year ago, a 36 percent drop. Revenue increased 2 percent, to $11.42 billion. Time Warner stock has languished for years as it cleared the wreckage from its ill-fated merger with AOL, and Wednesday’s news – which generally matched what analysts had anticipated – had little effect on the share price. Shares of Time Warner closed at $14.85 Wednesday, down 42 cents. AOL is still a question mark for Mr. Bewkes, who has been in discussions about a possible deal to combine it with Yahoo, which itself has been fighting off a bid from Microsoft. On Wednesday, Time Warner said that revenue at AOL – which has been in a seemingly perpetual state of transition from a subscriber business to an advertising business – declined 23 percent, to $1.1 billion. But relative to some of its peers in the media industry, Time Warner’s stock price appears cheap – at least, that was the hopeful sentiment among some investors and analysts. Mr. Haverty said that Turner and Warner Brothers were “a collection of businesses that anyone on the planet would say should be worth more than eight times trailing cash flow.” Laura Martin, an analyst at Soleil Media Metrics, told The Times, “the strength of the networks and film was an upside surprise.” Without cable, she said, Time Warner closely resembled Viacom, which combines a grouping of cable channels under the MTV Networks brand and the Paramount Pictures film studio. Time Warner’s film business had a 4 percent increase in revenue, to $2.84 billion from $2.74 billion in last year’s first quarter. The division’s profit declined, however, to $183 million, from $243 million in the year-ago period, reflecting a $116 million restructuring charge from reorganizing New Line Cinema. Mr. Bewkes said the unit’s television production would continue to be a source of growth, particularly from selling shows to cable networks, like FX, that are not owned by Time Warner. Another piece of Time Warner’s content business – although of lesser importance to investors – is its magazine publishing unit, Time Inc. The unit, which publishes Sports Illustrated, People, Time and Fortune, saw revenue remain essentially flat at about $ 1 billion, but its operating income, before depreciation and amortization, rose 73 percent, to $145 million. Time Warner is not the only big media company that has disavowed the industry mantra of marrying distribution and content. Rupert Murdoch, the controlling shareholder of News Corporation, recently agreed to give up control of the satellite company DirecTV in an asset swap with Liberty Media. Part of the rationale for the mantra in the first place was that owning both sides of the equation gave companies instant distribution when introducing new networks, as well as leverage with other cable companies. “There is huge growth in further original programming,” Mr. Bewkes said in an interview. “There’s more money in putting resources into HBO, TNT and TBS to create hits than into a start-up channel.” Go to Article from The New York Times » Go to Related</content>

		<content>Computer Security Start-Ups Catch Venture Capitalists’ Eyes - NYTimes.com The organizations attacked by pranksters, criminal syndicates or foreign governments include Google, LinkedIn and the Central Intelligence Agency. Big companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion on computer security this year, up 9 percent from last year. Small and medium-size businesses will spend more on security than on other information technology purchases in the next three years, according to the research firm International Data Corporation. Yet here in Silicon Valley, with all the feverish talk of innovation and billion-dollar start-ups, few entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have been eager to take on the security juggernauts Symantec and McAfee — and in many cases cybercriminals — for a piece of that action. That has started to change. In the last 12 months, the initial public offerings of once obscure security start-ups have outperformed offerings from household names like Facebook and Zynga. , a data security company that went public last year, finished 2011 among the year’s top offerings. Its shares jumped nearly 30 percent on their first day of trading, and remain 37 percent above the offering price. Zynga’s stock, by comparison, has plunged 73 percent since its offering last December. , a data security company, jumped nearly 65 percent from its offering in April. It raised $331 million in a secondary offering. Most recently, shares of The reason for the enthusiasm? “People are starting to realize that the billions of dollars that have been invested into traditional network security is not working for them anymore,” said Ted Schlein, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, the venture capital firm. Security start-ups have also become red-hot takeover targets. Apple, which has avoided big-ticket deals, agreed to for $356 million last month in its second-largest acquisition to date. And last year, the EMC Corporation, which already owned RSA, acquired NetWitness. The price was never disclosed but people close to the acquisition talks say Last year, they collectively poured $935 million into tech security companies, nearly double the $498 million they invested during 2010, according to a MoneyTree report compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters. “We’re seeing a flow of new entrepreneurs interested in the space,” said Asheem Chandna, a venture capitalist at Greylock who invested in Imperva and Palo Alto Networks. The rise of security start-ups is the product of a confluence of new technology, fear and people with a lot of money to invest. Major technological shifts, like the move to mobile devices and cloud storage, have redirected and increased the flow of information — for both employees and hackers. Hackers are becoming more sophisticated, too. Last year was the year of the “Advanced Persistent Threat,” or A.P.T., a computer attack in which hackers spend time researching a target and its intellectual property, figuring out who has access to it, and deploying any means necessary to steal it. RSA was the victim of such an attack last year. So were the military contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Speaking at a security conference last year, Timothy McKnight, Northrop Grumman’s chief security officer, said the company was fending off several such attacks a day. “The vast majority of companies have already been breached,” Shawn Henry, the F.B.I.’s former top computer security official, said in a recent interview. “I’ve looked at all sectors and the depth, penetration and breadth of these attacks are substantial.” The bulk of the attacks go undisclosed, either because companies don’t know they have been hit or because they fear what disclosure will mean for their stock prices. But the attacks that have surfaced have become headline-grabbing events, exposing the vulnerability of technology firms, government agencies and the security companies that people assumed were well protected. Bit9 was founded a decade ago but was largely unknown until 2010, when Google’s password system was breached and top-level executives started to pay attention. “In boardrooms, executives lifted their heads and asked, ‘Are we O.K.?’ ” Mr. Morley said. “We’ve grown 100 percent every year for the past two years. Before that, we didn’t see that kind of growth,” he said. Bit9, which roughly tripled its client base in two years, announced last week that it had raised $34.5 million in an investment round led by Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm. Mr. Chandna of Greylock said the bulk of security start-ups that solicit his firm fall into one of four categories: mobile security, authentication, intrusion detection and “big data” security companies. , a firm that blocks malware and spyware on consumers’ mobile devices, raised $78 million from top-tier firms like Accel Partners and Andreessen Horowitz. A range of new start-ups market a similar service to businesses that now must deal with the headache of employees’ bringing their iPhones and iPads to work and carting confidential intellectual property around with them. , a one-year-old start-up that tracks suspicious behavior by mobile apps, raised $6.5 million from Venrock, U.S. Venture Partners and others last May. , a security start-up that tracks intrusions in real time, has raised over $50 million from Intel Capital and others, and many say it is ripe for a nine-figure acquisition. Investing in security can entail unusual challenges. In some cases, venture capitalists have received death threats from online criminals. In others, criminals have shut down their sites altogether. Ray Rothrock, an investment partner at Venrock, said he had received threatening e-mails from such people. On occasion, his firm has hired security guards to protect its offices. Blue Security, an Israeli start-up backed by Benchmark Capital and others, was forced to shut down its antispam service in 2006 after criminals responded to its filtering technology with an aggressive counterattack. Spammers flooded its database servers with so much traffic that it took down Blue Security — and thousands of other Web sites with it — to the point that Internet service providers refused to host the service and it was forced to close. “The thing about security investments is that sometimes you don’t know where you’re going to land in terms of attracting attention from the bad guys,” Mr. Rothrock said. But, he said, the risks are still worth the rewards. “Security is a growing market and it will grow forever.”</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com TOP STORIES Walgreens to Take Stake in Alliance Boots for $6.7 Billion  |  The American drug store chain Walgreens has agreed to buy a 45 percent stake in Alliance Boots, the European pharmacy retailer, for $6.7 billion, in a deal that could allow Walgreens to take full control of Alliance Boots by 2015. The deal will create one of the world’s largest drug store and pharmacy retailers with more than 11,000 stores in 12 countries. The acquisition also would allow Walgreens to expand into overseas markets, and give Alliance Boots a presence in the Unites States that it has long wanted. “Today’s announcement represents an exciting opportunity to accelerate our five core strategies and advance that mission in the U.S. and now internationally,” Gregory Wasson, chief executive of Walgreens, said in a statement. Walgreens said it had offered shareholders in the European pharmacy and beauty retailer, which includes the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, $4 billion in cash and another $2.7 billion in company stock. It also has the option to buy the remaining 55 percent stake in Alliance Boots three years after the deal closes.DealBook » Regulators Join Dimon at House Panel Hearing  |  Jamie Dimon, the outspoken chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, is returning to Washington to face another round of questions about his bank’s multibillion-dollar trading loss.

He is sticking to the same script. Once again, he will apologize for the misstep while playing down its effect on the bank and the broader financial system. This time, Mr. Dimon will have company.

		<content>JPMorgan Works to Shore Up Support for Dimon - NYTimes.com JPMorgan Chase board members plan to meet with some big shareholders to make their case that Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, should remain its chairman as well, Susanne Craig and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook. The campaigning is unusually proactive this year, shareholders say, reflecting fears within JPMorgan that investors may be dissatisfied with management after last year’s multibillion-dollar trading debacle. Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools A vote to split the roles of chief executive and chairman would not be binding, but it would put pressure on the board and indicate that shareholders have lost faith in Mr. Dimon. “If the vote goes against the company and the board decides to split the role, some board members and shareholders are concerned that Mr. Dimon might resign rather than accept what would most likely be regarded as an affront,” DealBook writes. “Several shareholders have said privately that succession is a major factor in their decision-making process. In meetings with directors, the shareholders said they expected to ask about succession planning, and the board’s ability to exert influence on bank management.” While it is hard to predict how the vote will turn out, a few big shareholders can make a difference. Last year, about 40 percent of investors supported a proposal to split the roles. This year, firms that advise shareholders are expected to recommend again that the roles be separated. “Other big investors, including some that voted to keep the roles together last year, remain undecided, according to a number of shareholders who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of policies against talking to the media.” AS C.E.O. PAY RISES MODESTLY, PERKS SOAR  |  Last year was all about perks for chief executives. Median pay for the 100 highest-paid chief executives at big American companies rose just 2.8 percent last year to more than $14 million. Perks, meanwhile, rose 18.7 percent from the previous year to $320,635, according to an analysis by Equilar for The New York Times. Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts, for instance, enjoyed more than a million dollars’ worth of personal travel on his company’s private jet. The chief executive of Hertz, Mark Frissora, logged nearly a half-million dollars’ worth of personal travel on the corporate jet. The data, while preliminary, show how compensation has changed after the Dodd-Frank law, which requires companies to ask shareholders for input on pay. “In an age when shareholders can now make their collective views known publicly, it can seem downright provocative to let the company pick up the bill” for lavish perks, Nelson D. Schwartz writes in The Times. Alan Johnson, a consultant who advises boards on how best to structure compensation packages, called it “dumb with a capital D.” But there are signs that some companies may be thinking deeply about their pay practices. Alan R. Mulally of Ford Motor and James P. Gorman of Morgan Stanley faced pay cuts last year for their companies’ weak performance. “That’s the way it’s supposed to be,” Gretchen Morgenson, a columnist for The New York Times, writes. Even the highest-earning C.E.O.’s on the list from Equilar did not make as much as the kings of private equity and hedge funds, Pradnya Joshi writes in The New York Times. For instance, Leon Black, C.E.O. of Apollo Global Management, took in more than $125 million; only $287,000 was his base compensation and the rest was distributions from his shares in the firm. A chart showing the 100 highest-paid C.E.O.’s of public companies, with Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle on top, followed by Richard M. Bracken of the hospital chain HCA and Robert A. Iger of Disney, is available here. YAHOO CHIEF WOOS START-UPS  |  Marissa Mayer, who is trying to infuse Yahoo with an entrepreneurial spirit, “has been on a splashy shopping spree,” buying six start-ups since she took the reins last year, The New York Times writes. “Increasingly, entrepreneurs say, she is getting personally involved in acquisitions, focusing particularly on mobile-minded engineers. She is also trying to reverse Yahoo’s reputation as a company that acquires talent and innovative technologies and then lets them wither.” Still, “despite the string of purchases, some say Ms. Mayer’s pitch — which could be a part of the biggest technology turnaround since Steven P. Jobs’s return to Apple in 1996 — seems as if it is still in rehearsal.” The process of valuing a start-up can seem more like art than science, especially when the company has no revenue. “I have a vision of how suitors decide how much to offer for a start-up they want to buy,” Nick Bilton writes on the Bits blog. “Several executives go into a conference room.

		<content>A Town in New York Creates Its Own Department Store - NYTimes.com , a picturesque town in the Adirondacks, are a hardy lot — they have to be to withstand winter temperatures that can drop to 30 below zero. But since the local Ames department store went out of business in 2002 — a victim of its corporate parent’s bankruptcy — residents have had to drive to Plattsburgh, 50 miles away, to buy basics like underwear or bed linens. And that was simply too much. came knocking, some here welcomed it. Others felt that the company’s plan to build a 120,000-square-foot supercenter would overwhelm their village, with its year-round population of 5,000, and put local merchants out of business. It’s a situation familiar to many communities these days. But rather than accept their fate, residents of Saranac Lake did something unusual: they decided to raise capital to open their own department store. Shares in the store, priced at $100 each, were marketed to local residents as a way to “take control of our future and help our community,” said Melinda Little, a Saranac Lake resident who has been involved in the effort from the start. “The idea was, this is an added to the challenge — but the organizers reached their $500,000 goal last spring. By then, some 600 people had chipped in an average of $800 each. And so, on Oct. 29, as an early winter storm threatened the region, the opened its doors to the public for the first time. By 9:30 in the morning, the store, in a former restaurant space on Main Street opposite the Hotel Saranac, was packed with shoppers, well-wishers and the curious. The 4,000-square-foot space was not completely renovated — a home goods section will be ready for the grand opening on Nov. 19 — but shoppers seemed pleased with the mix of apparel, bedding and craft supplies for sale. “Ooh, that’s nice,” said Pat Brown, as she held up a slim black skirt (price: $29.99). She and her husband, Bob, a former professor of sociology at a local community college, live in town in an early 1900s home furnished with deer heads and other mementos from Bob’s hunting trips. The couple — who were voted king and queen of the village’s annual Winter Carnival in 1999 — bought $2,000 worth of shares in the store early on, and later bought a few more during a fund-raising drive. “It’s been a long process for all of us. We’re very proud to have it finally become a reality,” Ms. Brown said. Her husband, a vigorous-looking man who had a neatly trimmed white beard and was wearing a cowboy hat, added, “This is a small town trying to help itself.” — a department store owned by its customers that will not pick up and leave when a better opportunity comes along or a corporate parent takes on too much debt. Community-owned stores are fairly common in Britain, and not unfamiliar in the American West, where remote towns with dwindling populations find it hard to attract or keep businesses. But such stores are almost unknown on the densely populated East Coast. The Saranac Lake Community Store is the first in New York State, its organizers say, and communities in states from Maine to Vermont are watching it closely. Indeed, community ownership seems to resonate in these days of protest and unrest, when frustration with Wall Street, corporate America and a system seemingly rigged against the little guy is running high. But rather than simply grouse, some people are creating alternatives. “It drives me crazy when people criticize how our system works, but they don’t actually go out and try anything,” says Ed Pitts, a lawyer from Syracuse who along with his wife, Meredith Leonard, is a frequent visitor to the area and has invested in the store. “This is more authentic capitalism.” SARANAC LAKE is known more for its natural beauty and clean air than for experimenting with new forms of commerce. Nine miles from the Olympic town of Lake Placid, it is surrounded by lakes and mountains. In the past, it drew summer residents including Albert Einstein and Theodore Roosevelt, as well as tuberculosis patients who came to the village to take “the cure” of fresh air. Today, many of the village’s onetime “cure cottages” are filled with tourists who come in the summer months to hike, canoe and unwind, swelling the population threefold. Come winter, though, the town’s Main Street quiets down and local residents reclaim places like the Blue Moon Café, which dishes up food and gossip. So when the local Ames store closed, few major retailers were interested in taking its place, despite the town’s efforts to woo them.</content>

		<content>Wary of China, Companies Head to Cambodia - NYTimes.com PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Tiffany and Company is quietly building a diamond-polishing factory in Cambodia, a country popularly associated more with killing fields and land mines than baubles. Some of Japan’s biggest manufacturers are also rushing to set up operations in Phnom Penh to make wiring harnesses for cars and touch screens and vibration motors for cellphones. European companies are not far behind, making dance shoes and microfiber sleeves for sunglasses. Foreign companies are flocking to Cambodia for a simple reason. They want to limit their overwhelming reliance on factories in China. Problems are multiplying fast for foreign investors in China. Blue-collar wages have surged, quadrupling in the last decade as a factory construction boom has coincided with waning numbers of . Starting last year, the labor force has actually begun shrinking because of the “one child” policy and an aging population. “Every couple days, I’m getting calls from manufacturers who want to move their businesses here from China,” said But multinational companies are finding that they can run from China’s rising wages but cannot truly hide. The populations, economies and even electricity output of most Southeast Asian countries are smaller than in many Chinese provinces, and sometimes smaller than a single Chinese city. As companies shift south, they quickly use up local labor supplies and push wages up sharply. While wages and benefits often remain below levels needed to provide proper housing and balanced diets, the manufacturing investment — foreign direct investment in Cambodia rose 70 percent last year from 2011 — is starting to raise millions of people out of destitution. “People along the Mekong River are being lifted out of poverty by foreign investment inflows driven by higher Chinese wages,” said Peter Brimble, the senior economist for Cambodia at the Asian Development Bank. Only a smattering of companies, mostly in low-tech sectors like garment and shoe manufacturing, are seeking to leave China entirely. Many more companies are building new factories in Southeast Asia to supplement operations in China. China’s fast-growing domestic market, large population and huge industrial base still make it attractive for many companies, while productivity in China is rising almost as fast as wages in many industries. Foreign investment in China nonetheless slipped 3.5 percent last year, after rising every year since 1980 except 1999, during the Asian financial crisis, and 2009, during the global financial crisis. Still, at $119.7 billion, foreign investment in China continues to dwarf investment elsewhere. By comparison, investment in Cambodia rose to $1.5 billion. But last year was the first time since comparable recordkeeping began in the 1970s that Cambodia received more foreign investment per person than China. “People are not looking for exit strategies from China, they’re looking to set up parallel operations to hedge their bets,” said Bretton Sciaroni, another American lawyer here. Among Japanese makers, Sumitomo is making wiring harnesses for cars, Minebea is assembling parts for cellphones and Denso is about to start production of motorcycle ignition components. As companies compete for employees, working conditions in the region are improving. Pactics, a Belgian-run company that is the world’s largest maker of microfiber sleeves for luxury sunglasses, has introduced employee benefits that were previously rare in Cambodia, like medical insurance, accident insurance, education allowances and free lunches. Because costs are extremely low in Cambodia, where a visit to the doctor may cost only a couple of dollars, overall compensation for each worker is still less than $130 a month. At the company’s factory on the outskirts of Shanghai, workers doing the same tasks earn $560 to $640 a month, including government-mandated allowances, said Piet Holten, the company’s president. Cambodian workers sew 15 to 30 percent fewer sleeves per day than their Shanghai counterparts, but productivity in Cambodia has been catching up. “I will never get it up to China, but the cost is less than a third of China’s, and China only gets more expensive,” Mr. Holten said.</content>

		<content>After Bailout, Giants Dominate the Mortgage Business - NYTimes.com Mark Lennihan/Associated PressWilliam Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, criticized the concentration of mortgages. Mortgage rates are so low that it may seem like a great time to get a mortgage. For banks, however, it probably is the greatest time ever. The profit margin on the rates that they can charge customers and the price they can earn for selling those mortgages to investors is at a record. This is measured as the “spread,” or difference, between mortgage securities yields and mortgage rates. Given that housing prices are beaten up and borrowers must put down bigger cushions than in recent years, it is “the most profitable, safest time ever to be a mortgage bank,” says Scott Simon, who is the head of mortgage investing at Pimco. The Trade View all posts Article Tools In the old days, there used to be a word for this kind of thing: price gouging. And who is doing the gouging? Mainly, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. In the third quarter, reported in the last several weeks, both banks earned robust profits from the mortgage business. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley, vented this frustration in a recent speech, blaming the concentration of mortgage-making power at a few big banks. Alex Wong/Getty ImagesSheila C. Bair, former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, called it “a downside of the bailouts.” Mr. Dudley is right. But what he didn’t say was that his own institution (the Fed), his former boss (Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner) and the Bush and Obama administrations delivered us this mess. The broken mortgage market is the unintended consequence of the flawed banking bailout and the flaccid regulatory response in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The government and the regulators have had two broad approaches to banking oversight during the crisis and its aftermath. First, regulators coddled the troubled big banks. The two weak behemoths, Citigroup and Bank of America, were granted time to work off their bad loans. Regulators practiced forbearance, overlooking the self-inflicted debacles — mostly housing related — on their balance sheets. Regulators, meanwhile, encouraged the healthy giants to get even bigger by gobbling up the small and weak. So Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, and JPMorgan snapped up Washington Mutual. It would be foolish to blame Wells Fargo and JPMorgan for this situation. Restaurants with 100 customers waiting in line outside the door wouldn’t, and shouldn’t, be expected to lower their prices; why should banks? Yet allowing takeovers without forcing weak competitors to get healthy quickly leads to an oligopoly. Exhibit A: Wells Fargo and JPMorgan dominate the mortgage business. They should face some competition. Instead, their biggest threats, Citigroup and Bank of America, are, astonishingly, pulling out. Citigroup and Bank of America appear to have made a profound mistake. It’s one of the many strategic errors that ultimately got Vikram S. Pandit ousted as Citi’s chief executive. Mr. Pandit viewed mortgages as a “noncore” business for Citigroup. Whoops. But it’s not a surprising one. These are traumatized institutions, limping along, preoccupied by the past and unable to look forward, says Sheila Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and author of the new crisis account, “Bull by the Horns.” She rightly calls it “another downside of the bailouts. We simply propped up weak institutions instead of making them restructure.” The odd twist is that the Federal Reserve is a victim here, too. Despite its move to buy mortgage-backed securities in its latest round of extraordinary measures to lower interest rates, it can nudge them only so far because of the dysfunctional, noncompetitive market. Regulators could have broken up Citigroup and Bank of America, spinning off their mortgage operations into well-capitalized, nimble competitors. Perhaps they could have forced those banks to take big write-downs on their mortgage assets, settled their lawsuits and moved on, putting the past where it belongs. Bankers, of course, don’t like this analysis. It’s common for them and others to argue that what’s really ailing the mortgage market are delays in putting new Dodd-Frank mortgage rules in place, like the ones that define the standards for mortgages that can be bundled into securities. And, yes, that is probably hindering new competition from entering the market, though it certainly can’t fully, or even mostly, explain Citigroup and Bank of America abandoning the field. And, of course, the banks themselves bear much of the blame because they went all out to obstruct the rollout of new regulations. But, ultimately, the Dodd Frank delay is yet another example of how the government’s inefficient postcrisis process has hurt the marketplace. There has been plenty of talk about how the government saved the financial system after the crisis. And it did. Now the question is: Is this what we saved it for?

		<content>How Gadgets, Chips, Services Companies Are Faring - NYTimes.com Companies providing gadgets, components, services and related software have begun releasing their earnings reports for the latest quarter. The reports come as consumers shift their spending toward phone and tablets and away from traditional PCs. Here's a look at how selected companies are faring. — April 5: Estimates from Samsung Electronics Co. show that operating profit for the first quarter grew 53 percent from a year earlier to 8.7 trillion won ($7.7 billion), outpacing expectations for what's normally a slow time for consumer electronics sales. Revenue grew 15 percent to 52 trillion won. Analysts say Samsung benefited from smartphone sales and shortages in memory chips for personal computers. — April 10: Research firms IDC and Gartner release reports showing unprecedented declines in sales of desktop and laptop machines during the first three months of the year. IDC says first-quarter shipments of PCs fell 14 percent worldwide from a year earlier. That's the deepest quarterly drop since the firm started tracking the industry in 1994. Another research firm, Gartner Inc., pegged the first-quarter decline at 11 percent. IDC Vice President Bob O'Donnell says Microsoft's release on Windows 8 in October "not only didn't provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market. — April 16: Intel Corp, the world's largest maker of chips for PCs, remains steadfast amid the drastic slowdown in computer sales. It says it's keeping its sales and margin forecasts for this year. The company is helped by rising shipments of chips for servers. Intel says it shipped 7 percent fewer PC chips compared with a year earlier, but 6 percent more server chips. Intel meets analyst forecasts for the just-ended quarter. — April 18: Microsoft Corp. says revenue and net income surged in the latest quarter, but much the gains were due to the recognition of sales that occurred before the launch of the latest versions of Windows and Office. Microsoft's Windows division reports a 23 percent increase in revenue to $5.7 billion, but adjusting for the deferred revenue, revenue was flat. IBM Corp. says first-quarter net income fell 1 percent due to delays in closing several large software and mainframe computer deals. IBM is seen as a good gauge of technology demand because it sells to major companies and governments around the world. That said, it's not immune from economic uncertainty and currency fluctuations, which showed in the quarter's results. IBM says weakness in the Japanese yen hurt the quarter's results. A weak yen translates to fewer dollars for IBM on sales in Japan. Nokia Corp.'s earnings report shows that it continues to take a hammering in the smartphone market, with revenue falling by 20 percent to 5.8 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in the first three months of the year. Mobile phone sales volumes fell across the globe — especially in China, which saw a 60 percent drop. The number of smartphones sold dropped 49 percent to 6.1 million units. Sales of other phones fell 21 percent to 55.8 million. — April 23: Apple Inc. says it will distribute $100 billion in cash to its shareholders by the end of 2015. At the same time, the company says revenue for the current quarter could fall from the year before, which would be the first decline in many years. Apple CEO Tim Cook also suggests that the company won't release any new products until the fall, contrary to expectations that there would be a new and iPads out this summer. Apple shipped 37.4 million iPhones in the latest quarter, up 7 percent from a year ago. It shipped 19.5 million iPads, up 65 percent. Mac sales were flat at about 4 million. — April 24: Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. reports quarterly earnings and forecast that fall in line with analyst estimates. But that disappoints investors spoiled by the company's recent run of success as the growing popularity of smartphones fueled the demand for its mobile microprocessors. Although smartphone sales are still climbing, Qualcomm is now facing fiercer competition from other chip makers, including Intel, which has been redesigning its microprocessors in an attempt to grab a bigger piece of the mobile computing market. Data storage equipment maker EMC Corp. reports a small decline in its first-quarter net income. The results fall short of Wall Street's expectations as the pace of its revenue growth continued to slow. CEO Joseph Tucci says EMC's customers remain cautious about technology spending because of the "continuing tide of political and economic uncertainties." — April 26: Samsung says its first-quarter profit jumped to a record high as smartphone sales remained strong despite the April launch of an updated version of its flagship Galaxy phone. Sales of consumer electronics usually slow down in the quarter after the holiday shopping season, an effect that analysts thought would be compounded by people waiting for the release of the Galaxy S4. Samsung says sales of the older Galaxy S III smartphone and the oversized handset called the Galaxy Note remained strong. — May 2: Intel says it will promote Chief Operating Officer Brian Krzanich to be its next CEO, effective May 16. Krzanich, 52, will steer the world's largest chipmaker in an era where PC sales are cratering while smartphones and tablets thrive. In an interview, Krzanich said he will tackle the challenge of declining PC sales by relying on the assets that Intel is built on: its engineering prowess and enormous, billion-dollar chip factories, based on technologies that are years ahead of its competitors. — May 3: U.S. Cellular Corp., the only major U.S. wireless carrier to resist the iPhone, says it's going to start selling it this year. The company didn't specify exactly when the company would start selling Apple's phone, or what models it would carry. CEO Mary Dillon says many of the customers leaving the Chicago-based company are doing so because it doesn't carry the iPhone.</content>

		<content>Valeant to Buy Medicis, Maker of Dermatology Drugs - NYTimes.com Valeant said it would pay $44 in cash for each share of Medicis, 39 percent more than the stock’s Aug. 31 closing price. The transaction will close in the first half of 2013, Valeant, which is based in Montreal, said in a statement. The deal would be the largest for Valeant since it was created in a 2010 merger of the Biovail Corporation of Canada and a predecessor company that was based in Aliso Viejo, Calif. An effort to expand further last year with a $5.7 billion offer for Cephalon failed when the company’s bid was topped by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Medicis makes drugs to combat “The acquisition of Medicis represents a significant next step in our journey to become the leader in dermatology by strengthening Valeant’s presence in , aesthetic injectables and antivirals, among others,” J.

Valeant’s strategy is to mix larger deals with smaller ones, Mr. Pearson said in May during a conference call, focusing on ophthalmology and dermatology. Valeant had focused on treatments for the central nervous system and skin diseases. Valeant has made about 50 acquisitions of companies and assets since Mr. Pearson took over in 2008, Jared Levy, a company spokesman, said via e-mail.

		<content>10 Large Banks Allowed to Exit U.S. Aid Program - NYTimes.com Article Tools The Obama administration marked with little fanfare a major milestone in its bank rescue effort — its decision on Tuesday to let 10 big banks repay federal aid that had sustained them through the worst of the crisis — as policy makers and industry executives focused on the challenges still before them, The New York Times’s Eric Dash reports. “This is not a sign that our troubles are over,” President Barack Obama said. “Far from it.” While the announcement had been expected for weeks, the official word put the administration’s imprimatur on a corps of big banks considered healthy enough to extricate themselves from Washington’s grip. The bank holding companies, among them American Express, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, plan to return a combined $68.3 billion. That represents more than a quarter of the federal bailout money that the nation’s banks have received since last October, when many feared that failures might cascade through the industry. But the decision to allow the banks to exit the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, also ushered in a new, and potentially risky, phase of the banking crisis. Letting the lenders out now — earlier than many had envisioned, and without the industry reforms some consider necessary to prevent future crises — raises many sobering questions for policy makers, bankers and taxpayers. The program was aimed at purchasing assets and equity from banks to strengthen them and encourage them to expand lending during a tightening credit squeeze. But after banks return the TARP money, the administration will forfeit much of its leverage over them. With that loss goes a rare opportunity to overhaul the industry. The administration’s ability to push institutions to purge themselves quickly of bad assets and do more to help hard-pressed homeowners will be diminished. Of even deeper concern is the running trouble inside the banking industry. Despite tentative signs of revival, many banks remain fragile. Four of the nation’s five largest lenders, including Citigroup and Bank of America, were not allowed to return their bailout funds. Some analysts worry that financial institutions that repay bailout money now may turn to Washington again if the economy worsens and losses overwhelm banks. One of the most vexing problems of the credit crisis — how to rid banks of their troubled mortgage investments — remains unresolved. The banks are eager to escape TARP and the restrictions that come with it, particularly the limits on how much they can pay their 25 most highly compensated workers. (Even so, the Obama administration plans to propose guidelines on executive compensation for the broader industry as early as Wednesday.) Yet even banks that return taxpayers’ money will remain dependent on other forms of government aid. Among them are enhanced deposit insurance, incentive payments to modify home mortgages and federal guarantees on bonds that banks sell to raise capital. “They may need the government’s money to get through this storm,” Christopher Whalen, a managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics, said of the banks. “If the banks have to come back and ask for more money in a few months, I don’t think the response from Washington will be too kind.” Taxpayers — many of whom probably never imagined that banks would return their bailout money so soon, if ever —stand to make several billion dollars from their investment in the 10 banks. So far, the Treasury has collected about $1.8 billion in interest payments. It also might reap as much as $4.6 as the banks seek to expunge other government investments, known as warrants. The first round of repayments will free up billions of dollars that the administration can then funnel to other troubled banks and companies without having to return to Congress for more money. But homeowners and consumers are unlikely to benefit if banks repay their TARP funds en masse. Banks are giving back money that might otherwise be used to make loans. The announcement on Tuesday underscored the stark dividing line across the banking industry. On one side are big banks now considered healthy enough to forgo their TARP money. On the other side are those considered too weak to go without it. Still, some of those weaker banks may be allowed to repay the money soon. Mr. Obama, in remarks on Tuesday in the East Room of the White House, stopped short of declaring the crisis over. And the president, who has been harshly critical of multimillion-dollar bonuses for Wall Street executives, had a message for the banks that were returning the money. “I also want to say: the return of these funds does not provide forgiveness for past excesses or permission for future misdeeds,” he said. The Treasury did not name the banks, but the institutions quickly acknowledged the decision in a barrage of press releases on Tuesday morning. Morgan Stanley was among the first out with the news. American Express, Bank of New York Mellon, the BBandT Corporation, Capital One Financial, JP Morgan Chase, Northern Trust, the State Street Corporation and U.S. Bancorp soon followed. Goldman Sachs, which had pressed hard to repay the money, waited nearly two hours before issuing its release. None of the banks’ executives crowed publicly, but some of their employees celebrated Tuesday night. At an outdoor cafe on Stone Street, near Goldman’s headquarters in Lower Manhattan, Goldman employees toasted their freedom. “This one’s on me,” one called out from his table. “Yeah, as long as it’s not on the government,” a colleague replied. Nearby, at Ulysses pub, two Bank of New York Mellon employees nursed beers and predicted their lives — and pay — would improve, even if the broader economy did not, The Times reported. Rick Waddell, the chief executive of Northern Trust, acknowledged that many banks were still under pressure. “The environment remains challenging,” Mr. Waddell said in a memorandum. But he said it was in the best interest of “shareholders clients, partners and taxpayers to return this capital.” Even Henry M. Paulson Jr., who, as Treasury secretary, summoned banking executives to Washington last fall to press the TARP money on them, said in a statement on Tuesday that he did not see a quick end to the industry’s problems. “The recovery of our financial system is under way, but the road ahead is not short,” Mr. Paulson said. Still, some of his former staff members planned to celebrate. Before leaving the Treasury in January, the staff members joked that they would hold a reunion when the first dollar of the big banks’ TARP money was repaid. That day will most likely come next week, when the actual payments are expected to be made. “I guess we have to organize something — a quick run to the local bar for a drink,” Michele Davis, the former assistant Treasury secretary for public affairs, told The Times.

		<content>Michael Kors Stock, Like His Frocks, Is Selling Fast - NYTimes.com Peter Foley/Bloomberg NewsA Michael Kors store on Madison Avenue in New York. Tina Fineberg/Associated PressMichael Kors, who started his business in 1981, has developed a loyal following, including Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie. 8:29 p.m. | Updated Michael Kors seems to be everywhere. The fashion designer’s stores are popping up across the world, with his largest just opening in Paris. His oversize gold watches are white-hot Christmas gifts. As a judge on Lifetime’s “Project Runway,” Mr. Kors is also a staple on cable television. His latest debut is less haute couture and more high finance. On Wednesday, his Hong Kong-based company, where Mr. Kors is the chief creative officer, priced its initial public offering at $20, above the expected range of $17 to $19. The stock sale, which raised nearly $950 million, values the company at $3.8 billion. The I.P.O. caps a period of extraordinary growth for the company. Profits are on track to more than double this year, and sales are increasing at an annual rate of about 60 percent. Such rapid expansion has raised the eyebrows of retail analysts, who question whether the Kors label will maintain its cachet or succumb to the fickleness of fashion. Article Tools “Everybody wants to be the next Ralph Lauren,” said Faye Landes, a retail analyst at Consumer Edge Research in Stamford, Conn. “But how lasting the brand will be remains an open question.” Kors is also selling its shares into a choppy market. Investors have shied away from unproven companies, amid concerns over the European debt crisis and the sluggish United States economy. Stock of several hot debuts, like the Internet companies Groupon and Pandora, have dropped below their offering prices. Newly public fashion stocks have been soft, too. Prada, the Italian luxury retailer, is down since its debut, while a rival, Ferragamo, is flat. Analysts are worried that Kors could suffer too, especially with the insiders paring back their holdings through the I.P.O. and an earlier private sale of shares. The stock is set to start trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker KORS. For now, it appears Kors stock is as hot as its dresses. Orders for the I.P.O. greatly exceeded the amount of shares sold, people briefed on the deal said, driving up the price of the offering. “In the early days of trading, the hot money drives the performance of Michael Kors, the stock,” said John E. Fitzgibbon Jr., publisher of IPOscoop.com. “But over time, as that moves out, investors will start to focus on Michael Kors, the company.” Michael Kors, the person, was born Karl Anderson Jr. He changed his first name and borrowed the last name, Kors, from his mother’s second husband, Bill Kors, who had adopted him. He grew up in Merrick, N.Y., which he has called the home of “Olympic shoppers” and credits with fostering his fashion sense. Mr. Kors, a Fashion Institute of Technology dropout, designed a collection for Lothar’s, the Manhattan boutique, now defunct. He started his own business in 1981, creating designer apparel that developed a cult following among the Upper East Side crowd. Today, trendsetters like Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie favor his frocks. But most of the company’s recent growth has come from its lower-end Michael by Michael Kors line, which sells sequined wrap dresses for $150 and python-embossed shoulder bags for $228. The cheaper clothes and purses, which a Kors executive described to potential investors last week as “Hermès for Staten Island,” are big sellers at Macy’s and Lord and Taylor. Or, as Mr. Kors put it in an interview with Women’s Wear Daily, “It doesn’t matter what your pocketbook is, everyone wants to look thin and rich.” While not affecting Mr. Kors’s waistline, the I.P.O. will make him rich. Mr. Kors, 52, the company’s honorary chairman and chief creative officer, is selling stock worth about $117 million, or roughly a third of his holdings. He maintains an 8.6 percent ownership stake, worth about $327 million at the offering price. The I.P.O. adds to a year of personal milestones for Mr. Kors. In August, he and his boyfriend, Lance LePere, married in a barefoot ceremony on Dune Beach in Southampton. They met two decades ago when Mr. LePere worked as an intern at Michael Kors. Today, Mr. LePere is the creative director of the company’s women’s line. Kors stock, in many ways, is not a bet on Mr. Kors, but on Lawrence S. Stroll and Silas K. F. Chou, the fashion tycoons who control the majority of the company’s stock and have fueled its growth. Mr. Stroll and Mr. Chou run Sportswear Holdings Limited, which acquired Kors in 2003 for about $100 million. Their ambitions were to bring the luxury sensibility of Mr. Kors to the masses and turn it into the next great American designer firm. They sought to replicate their success with the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation. Mr. Stroll and Mr. Chou were early Tommy Hilfiger investors in the late 1980s and aggressively expanded that business, pushing it into department stores and broadening its customer base. The two men made millions when the company went public in 1992. (Today, Tommy Hilfiger is owned by the apparel giant PVH Corporation.) Retail analysts say that while Mr. Stroll and Mr. Chou have a record of success, they have also had some stumbles, including their failed investment in Asprey, the London luxury brand. They also point to some specific concerns with the Kors deal. Because the company is based in Hong Kong and Mr. Stroll and Mr. Chou control the majority of its stock, Kors does not have to comply with certain New York Stock Exchange corporate governance requirements. For instance, the company will not be required to have a majority of independent board members. The I.P.O. does not include Kors’s Chinese business, which is a separate entity and remains controlled by Mr. Stroll, Mr. Chou and Mr. Kors. That means that the company, at least for now, will not benefit from the tremendous growth that other luxury retailers have seen in China. Another red flag is the large amount of stock being sold by the owners. Besides Mr. Kors’s stake, the holding company of Mr. Stroll and Mr. Chou is selling $519 million worth of stock. After the I.P.O., they will own 35 percent of the company, worth $1.4 billion. It is the second time this year the owners have cut their holdings. This summer, they sold $500 million worth of shares in a private sale to mutual fund firms like Fidelity and T. Rowe Price. “There are aspects of this deal that are opaque,” said Ms. Landes, the analyst. “Plus, the fact that the insiders are selling so much stock is a potential cause for concern.” This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: December 14, 2011 An earlier version of this article misstated the network currently showing "Project Runway," the cable television series on which Michael Kors is a judge. It is now shown on Lifetime; it was previously shown on Bravo.</content>

		<content>Apple Wins Partial Victory on Patent Claim Over Android Features - NYTimes.com In addition to antenna designs and other traditional patents that are held by cellular companies, relative newcomers to the business, like Apple and Microsoft, are using patents that originated from computer products. Apple applied for one of the patents at issue in the HTC case — for detecting phone numbers and other forms of data — in 1996, 11 years before the iPhone was released. “Convergence threw them all together and opened up new product opportunities,” said James E. Bessen, an economist and lecturer at the Boston University School of Law. The HTC Corporation sold more than 12 million cellphones in the third quarter, according to Gartner. That made the company the world’s seventh-largest seller of cellphones, ahead of Motorola and just behind Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry. Its  phones include the Droid Incredible, an Android phone sold by Verizon Wireless and the HTC Titan, which has the Windows Phone operating system and is sold by ATandT. HTC said it would comply with the commission’s ruling by removing a feature that currently gives users a list of options whenever they receive, say, a phone number in a message on their smartphones. The users will no longer get a menu giving them the choice to save the phone number in their contact lists, dial the number or send a text message to it. Instead, HTC said it would give them only the option of dialing the number. United States Customs and Border Protection will determine whether HTC’s changes are sufficient to comply with the ruling. Apple is thought to have sued HTC, along with Samsung, another maker of Android phones and tablets, rather than Google itself because those companies profit directly from the sale of Android products. Patent lawyers say a frontal assault on Google would be a tougher legal challenge because the company gives away its Android operating system to hardware makers, making money instead through advertising from Internet services on Android phones. Oracle has sued Google directly, accusing it of patent infringement through Android. The British telecom provider BT on Monday said it also sued Google, in part over alleged patent infringements in Android. Patent lawsuits among technology companies typically end up being settled or avoided entirely through cross-licensing deals, with the weaker party often agreeing to pay a licensing royalty on every product sold containing the technology in question. Microsoft, for example, signed licensing agreements with HTC, Samsung and other companies in which Microsoft receives an undisclosed royalty from the sale of their Android devices. Apple appears less motivated by getting royalties from the companies it is suing, though some patent experts believe that could be posturing on its part. Mr. Jobs’s criticisms took on more urgency as Android began to gain a bigger share of the smartphone market during the last two years. But when he expressed those criticisms to his biographer, Walter Isaacson, he said he told Eric E. Schmidt, now the executive chairman of Google and a former Apple board member, that he didn’t want money from Google. “If you offer me $5 billion, I won’t want it,” Mr. Jobs told Mr. Schmidt, according to the book, “Steve Jobs.” “I’ve got plenty of money. I want you to stop using our ideas in Android, that’s all.” Mr. Mueller, the patent analyst, says he believes Apple is unlikely to settle with its Android rivals because it has the most of any company to lose from the rise of Android. “The Apple rhetoric from the beginning was about theft of intellectual property,” said Mr. Mueller, who has done research work for Microsoft, a Google competitor. “That’s a lot more combative.” Google has amped up its own rhetoric as well. In early August, David Drummond, the company’s senior vice president and chief legal officer, decried “a hostile, organized campaign against Android by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents.” Less than two weeks later, though, Google announced a plan to acquire the cellphone maker Motorola Mobility Holdings for $12.5 billion, a move that was viewed partly as an effort to bolster Google’s weak patent portfolio in the mobile business. That deal is still pending. While the subject of Android was clearly an emotional issue for Mr. Jobs, there’s no evidence yet that his death in October has altered Apple’s willingness to reach a compromise with makers of Android products. An article on Tuesday about a federal trade ruling that some features in smartphones that use Google’s Android software infringe on an Apple patent misidentified the operating system of the HTC Titan, a product of the HTC Corporation. The Titan runs on Windows Phone software, not on Android.</content>

		<content>PayPal Expands Further Into Stores, but Wal-Mart Holds Out - NYTimes.com SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - PayPal is extending its reach to more physical stores, having signed up 50 merchant acquirers which help process payments but the eBay Inc unit has yet to persuade Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer. PayPal's expansion into brick-and-mortar stores gives the company access to a market that is roughly ten times the size of the online payments sector where it got its start over a decade ago. Recent deals for Discover Financial Services, PayPal's offline partner, will help extend PayPal's in-store payment service to more than two million outlets in the United States by the end of 2013. Total System Services Inc and Heartland Payment Services Inc, two of the largest merchant acquirers, signed up in recent weeks, joining other big players such as Vantiv Inc, WorldPay, Global Payments Inc and First American Payments, according to executives at Discover and PayPal. Linking up with merchant acquirers is crucial to the PayPal offline push because these companies are important cogs in the payments ecosystem, signing up and underwriting merchants for payment networks including Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc and Discover. Recent merchant acquirer agreements mean merchants, including fast-food giant Burger King, cosmetics retailer Sephora and gadget seller Brookstone, will accept PayPal in their stores by the end of this year. Discover also works directly with about 1,500 of the largest retailers in the United States and it has been negotiating with them to accept PayPal in their stores. Nordstrom Inc, a big department store operator, recently signed up for PayPal in-store payments through a direct relationship with Discover, according to Don Kingsborough, the executive overseeing PayPal's offline expansion. However, Wal-Mart has so far resisted attempts by Discover and PayPal to get PayPal into its big-box stores. "Walmart does not accept PayPal in-store," Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove wrote in an email to Reuters. "The added complexity at the point of sale does not justify acceptance of PayPal," he said. Using PayPal often requires more than a basic card swipe. One way to pay is to input a mobile phone number and a four digit PIN. Kingsborough said PayPal is focused on removing "friction" and added that the service helps merchants "engage with consumers in innovative ways on top of our core payments infrastructure." During a mobile payments conference panel in San Francisco in November that included PayPal President David Marcus, an executive from Wal-Mart's e-commerce business, Gibu Thomas, said the retailer had to be careful not to inadvertently introduce another "middle man" into the payment process. Wal-Mart is working on a rival mobile payment technology called Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX, with other large retailers including Gap Inc, Lowe's Companies Inc and CVS Caremark Corp.</content>

		<content>The Pressure Is On at Citigroup - NYTimes.com PRESSURE IS ON AT CITI  |  The new chief executive of Citigroup, Michael L. Corbat, “may have to impress quickly, given the pent-up frustrations among shareholders,” DealBook’s Peter Eavis writes. With the stock price having fallen 89 percent under Mr. Corbat’s predecessor, Vikram S. Pandit, investors want the new leader to speed up the bank’s overhaul and be more transparent about the process. But it was not clear on Tuesday what his actual plan was. “Today’s changes do not alter the strategic direction of Citi, which we believe is a good one,” Mr. Corbat said during his first public conference call as chief executive. Still, he suggested the personnel change itself signaled change: “I wouldn’t minimize the impact you can have on a place.” Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools The transition on Tuesday caught Wall Street off guard, surprising even the bank’s employees. But the board had been preparing for weeks, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Susanne Craig report for DealBook. The chairman, Michael E. O’Neill, and other board members “had been mapping out the transfer of power during meetings that occurred, in part, while Mr. Pandit was in Japan last week attending a gathering of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,” DealBook reports. Mr. Pandit, though, said in an interview that the decision to resign was his alone. Shareholders seemed to welcome Tuesday’s news. Christine Harper of Bloomberg News noted on Twitter: “Citigroup ousts C.E.O., shares rise 1.6%. Goldman Sachs reports profit that beats analyst estimates, shares fall 1%.” Citigroup’s board, wrote James Greiff of Bloomberg View, seemed to have arrived at “the same conclusion that many in the financial world had settled on long ago.”   BANK OF AMERICA EKES OUT A PROFIT  |  Bank of America managed to post a slim third-quarter profit after agreeing to settle legal claims stemming from its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. The bank reported net income of $340 million, compared with $6.23 billion in the quarter a year ago. The earnings amounted to zero cents a share, better than the loss of 6 cents a share that analysts were expecting. The conference call on Wednesday to discuss the results is being held at 8:30 a.m. BlackRock said its third-quarter profit rose 17 percent on an adjusted basis, to $610 million. The firm’s diluted earnings amounted to $3.47 a share, beating analysts’ expectations of $3.32 a share.   LAWMAKERS FOCUS ON CAPITAL  |  Two Senate lawmakers, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and David Vitter of Louisiana, are raising concerns about bank capital rules in a letter to be sent to regulators on Wednesday morning. The letter, which was obtained by DealBook, elaborates on one the pair sent to Ben S. Bernanke in August. And it is notable for its bipartisan nature: Mr. Brown, a Democrat, and Mr. Vitter, a Republican, tend not to agree on many issues. “We write today to urge your agencies to simplify and enhance the capital rules that will apply to U.S. banks,” they say in the letter to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Vitter is appearing on CNBC at 10:30 a.m. The debate over Wall Street regulation has been a feature (although perhaps not a huge one) in the presidential race, with Mitt Romney arguing that the Dodd-Frank law should be repealed. But getting rid of the regulatory overhaul “will turn back the financial clock to 2006” for big banks, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. “That doesn’t seem very smart given what happened, something that Mr. Romney recognizes when he talks of replacing the act rather than repealing it. The problem is that possible replacements are unlikely to work.”   ON THE AGENDA  |  Knight Capital, Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp and PepsiCo report earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday.

		<content>California's Glimmer of Hope: Nanotechnology - NYTimes.com Article Tools The economic news in California has been pretty bleak lately. Its businesses, small and large, are becalmed by the recession. The state has taken to issuing i.o.u.’s in the wake of political wrangling over how to resolve a $26 billion budget deficit. Most ominous, the state’s once-great public universities and its community colleges and local schools face budget cuts that amount to critical surgery. Yet in the midst of all that, there is a promise for the future in the collaboration by California’s university research centers, small companies and venture finance firms in an emerging area called nanotechnology, The New York Times’s James Flanigan writes. Working with materials that are a thousandth the diameter of a human hair, nanotechnology companies do not produce finished products in any one industry. Rather, nano particles improve performance and open new possibilities in activities as varied as water purification, biomedicine, battery power, environmental repair and agriculture. The universities have been essential in this development process. In some cases, they make direct equity investments in start-up companies. Other times, universities grant licenses to their research and give small companies access to expensive laboratory equipment in return for user fees. And some universities have set up incubators where small companies develop technological products and processes. Why are universities investing scarce budget cash in start-up companies? “Partnerships with private industry are a way of making this new technology available for public benefit,” Leonard H. Rome, interim director of the California NanoSystems Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, told The Times. Also, in times of strained budgets, such partnerships bring needed funds. The NanoSystems Institute, Mr. Rome said, “has attracted more than $350 million in research and development grants from industry.” Moreover, the new nanotechnology industry demands interdisciplinary collaboration. “The medical school needs to be collaborating with the engineering school,” said Mr. Rome, who is also senior associate dean of research at the university’s School of Medicine. In fact, the institute was first authorized in 2000 as part of a $100 million grant from the state of California to spur university research. Examples from several universities and fledgling companies demonstrate the potential. NanoH2O Inc., for instance, uses nano materials to improve the performance of reverse osmosis membranes in making dirty water clean or in desalination. Two years ago, the company licensed the membrane research of Eric Hoek, a professor of environmental engineering at U.C.L.A. Then it leased lab space in the NanoSystems Institute, which opened in 2007, because being at U.C.L.A. allowed the company to use expensive electron microscopes and other equipment. “Being able to use the core facilities of the university couldn’t help but accelerate our progress,” Jeff Green, chief executive of NanoH2O, told The Times. It also helped attract $20 million in venture capital from Oak Investment Partners and Khosla Ventures. Now, NanoH2O is moving to a factory where it can manufacture membranes composed partly of nano-size elements of alumina and silicon. The membranes filter out salts and impurities yet allow water to flow faster, thus saving energy in desalination or water reuse processes. Matrix Sensors Inc. is a new tenant at the NanoSystems Institute. The company is developing nano membranes that are so sensitive to resonance they can detect molecules of bacteria as well as proteins and DNA and thus diagnose early stages of illness. Matrix Sensors is working on licensed research of three professors, James K. Gimzewski of U.C.L.A., and Calvin F. Quate and Butros T. Khuri-Yakub of Stanford University. U.C.L.A. and Stanford have invested in the company, along with Miramar Venture Partners of San Diego, which has put in $1 million. That is a sign, said Michael Cable, chief executive of Matrix, that investors, even in the recession, are supporting nanotechnology. QuantumSphere Inc., in Santa Ana, Calif., is approaching nanotechnology on a broad scale by making an array of catalysts that allow batteries to operate for longer periods, electronic displays to be manufactured at lower costs and ammonia fertilizers to be produced using less energy while also generating less carbon dioxide. “It’s not a question of making nano materials alone but what applications are you using nano for,” said Kevin D. Maloney, president of QuantumSphere, a seven-year-old company that got its start with $100,000 investment from two angel investors: Jon Faiz Kayyem, a trustee of California Institute of Technology, and Marc H. Goroff, who has a doctorate from Caltech and is the founder of several companies. The reason infinitesimal nano particles can give batteries more power is, paradoxically, “that at the nano stage there are more atoms available on the surface of a molecule proportionate to its volume, so there are more active atoms to store and release electricity,” Douglas Carpenter, co-founder and senior science adviser of QuantumSphere, told The Times. Mr. Carpenter designed rocket fuel for aerospace companies for many years and helped invent Quantum’s nano catalysts. “At the nano level, elements change their properties,” Mr. Carpenter explained. Aluminum, for instance, cannot burn at micron levels, or one millionth of a meter, but burns and gives off an intensely glowing light at nano levels, or one billionth of a meter. QuantumSphere gets to do research on powerful microscopes and other equipment at the University of California, Irvine, paying fees to the university for each use. It has raised $17 million from private equity and venture funds, including $2 million from OM Group Inc., a specialty chemicals company based in Cleveland. In an example of global collaboration, Rachid Yazami, research director of France’s National Center for Scientific Research, has done his work on battery technology since 2000 at Caltech. He is co-founder along with a Caltech professor, Robert H. Grubbs, of CFX Battery Inc., of Azusa, Calif., which makes lithium ion batteries that can power electric cars, medical devices, mobile phones and computers. The technology transfer office at Caltech invested in CFX and helped raise $15 million to get the company started. “But lithium is expensive and coming into short supply,” Mr. Yazami told The Times. So he is trying to develop a battery powered by nano particles of sodium and water. “You know the work of Jules Verne,” Mr. Yazami asked, referring to “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.” “He wrote of using seawater as a battery.” Go to Article from The New York Times »</content>

		<content>Credit Rating Agencies Settle Lawsuits Over Debt Vehicles - NYTimes.com Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s have settled two long-running lawsuits seeking to hold them responsible for misleading investors about the safety of risky debt vehicles that they had rated. , a unit of Moody’s Corporation, and S.and P., a unit of McGraw-Hill Companies, of negligent misrepresentation over their activities regarding the Cheyne and Rhinebridge structured investment vehicles. Morgan Stanley, which marketed both debt vehicles and helped structure the Rhinebridge one, also settled. Settlement terms were not disclosed in the cases, which had been brought in 2008 and had sought more than $700 million of damages. Both lawsuits were dismissed with prejudice, meaning they cannot be brought again. Spokesmen for Moody’s, McGraw-Hill and Morgan Stanley confirmed their companies’ settlements on Friday. “This settlement allows us to put the significant legal defense and related costs, as well as the distraction, of these very protracted litigations behind us,” said a Moody’s spokesman, Michael Adler. A spokesman for McGraw-Hill, Jason Feuchtwanger, said the company’s settlement involved no admission of wrongdoing. A trial in the Cheyne case had been scheduled for May 6 before United States District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan, who oversaw both lawsuits. Credit rating agencies have been accused by investors, regulators and politicians of inflating the ratings of risky mortgage-backed and structured securities in a bid to win new business. Critics said these activities also fueled demand from investors who thought the ratings were objective, but prices collapsed once the risks materialized, helping incite the 2008 global financial crisis.

		<content>Silicon Valley Style Quickly Clashed at J.C. Penney - NYTimes.com Suddenly, employees were changing price tags on tens of thousands of items. When an executive warned that Mr. Johnson’s sales projections for the coming quarter were too optimistic, he declined to adjust them, the executive said. When the new pricing was introduced in 2012, sales fell. Mr. Johnson believed his taste was paramount, executives said. In January 2012, Penney unveiled its new strategy at Pier 57 in Chelsea, covering the room in pure white to signal that Mr. Johnson brought “fresh air” to Penney. The day before the event, Mr. Johnson tried out the attendees’ chairs, found them lacking, and paid to have them replaced with white folding chairs suitable for a wedding. Similarly, as Penney designed its in-store boutiques, Mr. Johnson pushed for the best shelving and signage, though cheaper options were fine, an employee said. Recently, Penney has backtracked on that, asking vendors to cover the costs for those in-store shops as it runs low on cash. In a push to make Penney into, as Mr. Johnson called it, Bloomingdale’s for Middle America, he ordered merchandising executives to move away from frumpy categories like maternity wear and toward slim-fit polos and European-cut suits — despite the fact that many shoppers went to Penney for figure-forgiving basics, according to two former executives. He got rid of about 400 existing brands. In case shoppers weren’t getting the point that they weren’t good enough, Penney ran an Oscars ad telling customers they “ ” “If you’re a certain customer and you’ve been shopping Penney’s, that’s kind of insulting,” a former executive said. “You’re going to come in and say, there’s nothing for me.” One of Mr. Johnson’s most prominent partnerships, with Martha Stewart, puzzled employees. He decided that to remake Penney, he needed to remake the home department, and do it with Ms. Stewart — who had an exclusive contract with Macy’s. “Martha is the key,” he wrote in an October 2011 e-mail to himself.

Mr. Johnson directed a “simplification” team to get rid of many of Penney’s longstanding processes. In 2012, he revoked access to Penney’s sales data for all but the top executives. But that took away valuable information: the buyer for, say, men’s big and tall could not see how women’s plus size was performing. As sales tumbled, executives said, Mr. Johnson finally seemed inclined to listen. “Once his strategy got rolled out,” said a former employee, “he would ask all the time: what do you think? Do you think it’s working?” Though Mr. Johnson was quick to make changes, like abandoning the “simple” pricing strategy and reinstituting promotions, it was too late. For 2012, Penney’s revenue dropped 25 percent, to $13 billion. The problems are persisting in the current quarter. Michael Binetti, an analyst at UBS, said he believed that new introductions like Joe Fresh apparel were not hitting sales targets and that the heavy discounting Penney had resorted to suggested that sales were way down. The continued slump probably forced the board’s hand. Over the weekend, the chairman made his first contact with Mr. Ullman about taking back the wheel from Mr. Johnson. Because of an editing error, a timeline with an earlier version of this article misstated the date when J.C. Penney said it was acquiring a stake in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.

		<content>SandP 500 Closes at Record, Led by Energy, Tech Shares - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (Reuters) - The SandP 500 index ended at an all-time high on Monday as growth-oriented stocks, including energy and technology, lead the way to the index's sixth rise in the past seven sessions. Stronger-than-expected housing data also boosted the market, as did Italy's formation of a new government, ending months of uncertainty and raising hopes for new policies to promote growth in the euro zone's third-largest economy. Pressure has grown on the European Central Bank to lower interest rates with the euro zone mired in recession. Money market traders are evenly split on whether the ECB will cut rates at its meeting on Thursday, according to a Reuters poll. Wall Street followed European stocks higher as Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta urged a focus on growth policies and away from austerity measures in his inaugural speech. "After the election there was a lot of uncertainty about whether Italy could form a government, so now there is not only a great deal of relief over that, but also expectations for additional monetary policies from the ECB," said Alec Young, global equity strategist at SandP Equity Research in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 106.20 points, or 0.72 percent, at 14,818.75. The Standard and Poor's 500 Index was up 11.37 points, or 0.72 percent, at 1,593.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 27.76 points, or 0.85 percent, at 3,307.02. The U.S. Federal Reserve will also meet this week for a two-day session beginning on Tuesday. The Fed is expected to maintain its stimulus policy. Data on Monday showing muted inflation gave the Fed room for accommodative measures. Also lifting markets was Apple Inc, which jumped 3.1 percent to $430.12 after taking initial steps for what would be its first debt sale. Technology stocks rose 1.7 percent, making the sector the best-performing on Monday. A report showed contracts to buy previously owned homes rose last month to their highest level since April 2010, showing underlying strength in the housing market recovery, even though the pace of sales growth has cooled in recent months. "The market's trend continues to be higher, but it is still attractive at these valuations," said Young, who has a 12-month target of 1,670 for the SandP. About 71 percent of New York Stock Exchange-listed companies closed higher while 65 percent of companies traded on the Nasdaq ended in positive territory. Volume was light, with about 5.10 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.36 billion shares. Moody's Corp was the SandP 500's top percentage gainer, jumping 8.3 percent to $59.69 after the company settled a lawsuit alleging that it had misled investors about the safety of risky debt vehicles it had rated. McGraw-Hill Cos, whose Standard and Poor's unit said it settled similar suits, rose 2.8 percent to $53.45. Roper Industries Inc fell 3.8 percent to $118.68 after reporting first-quarter revenue that missed expectations, though it raised its full-year profit outlook. Of the 274 companies in the SandP 500 that have reported earnings to date for current season, 69 percent have beat analysts' expectations and 43.2 percent have reported revenue above expectations.</content>

		<content>Wal-Mart Pays Some Board Members More on Bribery Probe Work - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Monday that members of its board's audit committee were paid more for the latest year because of extra work they had to take on to handle an ongoing investigation into alleged foreign bribery. The world's largest retailer also said in its annual proxy statement that the cash incentives for its top executives in 2014 would be partly based on meeting certain compliance objectives. While incentives for senior executives will still be based on financial and growth targets, there will be compliance goals that executives will have to meet as part of the new plan. Executives who do not meet these goals could see their annual cash incentives reduced or eliminated, according to the regulatory filing. Back in November 2011, Wal-Mart began its own probe into matters including alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and whether such matters were appropriately handled by the company. The issue was brought into the public spotlight one year ago, when the New York Times published a report that described how Wal-Mart had intentionally stifled an early internal probe into allegations that Wal-Mart de Mexico Wal-Mart said on Monday that it was "implementing enhancements to how we report and investigate allegations of wrongdoing worldwide." During fiscal 2013, which ended in January, the audit committee met 15 times while other committees met five times or seven times, and the full board met six times, Wal-Mart said. Members of the audit committee were paid an additional $60,000 fee, while the committee's chairman, Christopher Williams, received an $85,000 fee, the company said. Wal-Mart said that because of the audit committee's extra work, it decided to double the cash portion of the annual retainer for audit committee members, and doubled the chair fee for the chair of the audit committee. Williams earned $189,000 in fees for fiscal 2013, the most of any of the 15 board members who are not part of Wal-Mart's management team. Williams, who is chairman and CEO of investment bank Williams Capital Group, has been on Wal-Mart's board since 2004. In last year's board elections, when some shareholders voted against certain board members due to the foreign bribery allegation issue, 13.3 percent of votes were cast against him. Wal-Mart spent $157 million last year on its probe of alleged bribery allegations in Mexico, Brazil, China and India, and on improvements to its compliance programs. Separately, three board members will not stand for re-election at the company's June 7 annual meeting. In addition, Chief Executive Mike Duke and some other executives were paid more last year as sales and profit grew. The company said that James Breyer, the board's presiding director, and M. Michele Burns are each leaving the board after more than 10 years of service. Meanwhile, Arne Sorenson has decided to focus on his role as chief executive of Marriott International Inc. Sorenson is one of the members of the audit committee. Duke earned $20.7 million last year, up from $18.1 million a year earlier, as the retailer continued to grow despite a sluggish U.S. economy and concerns over the alleged international bribery. Wal-Mart noted that Duke will earn a significant majority of his overall compensation only if the company meets certain performance goals. Wal-Mart's total sales rose 5 percent to $466.11 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January, while earnings per share rose 10.6 percent to $5.02 per share. Sales at Walmart U.S., the company's largest unit, rose 3.9 percent to $264.19 billion. Meanwhile, groups that often complain about Wal-Mart's business practices on Monday asked for the removal of Duke and Chairman Rob Walton, a son of deceased founder Sam Walton, from the board. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and its OUR Walmart subsidiary said that letters were sent to Wal-Mart's global ethics office calling for Wal-Mart's board to remove Duke and Rob Walton "for their failure in leadership in preventing the alleged bribery, trying to cover it up" and not taking meaningful action to fix internal problems. The letters were dated April 22, which coincided with the anniversary of the publication of the New York Times report. The story was published online on April 21, 2012, and appeared in the April 22, 2012, print edition of the newspaper. Shares of Wal-Mart slipped 0.4 percent to $77.97 on Monday. They had reached an all-time high of $79.28 one week ago. (Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago; Additional reporting by Liana B.

		<content>Second Proxy Advisor Backs Relational/CalSTRS on Timken Split - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said Timken Co shareholders should vote for a non-binding proposal to break up the company's ball-bearings and steel businesses. The break up was proposed by activist hedge fund Relational Investors and the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS). Glass Lewis was the second major proxy advisory firm to back the proposal. Institutional Shareholder Services made a similar recommendation earlier in the week. Timken management opposes a split, saying the integrated company enjoys a variety of advantages that would be destroyed if the company were broken in two. The United Steel Workers union has sided with management on the issue. Glass Lewis said in its report that "shareholders would strongly benefit from a more thorough review of this potential strategic alternative. The incumbent board has displayed, in our view, a clear and troubling track record of responsiveness to shareholder concern and, perhaps of greater note here, has strongly expressed its intention to pursue the status quo." Relational Investors and CalSTRS believe a split would create two companies with a combined market capitalization larger than the current one. "We thought our case was compelling from the beginning - it's been reflected in the stock price," David Batchelder, co-founder and principal of Relational, said in an interview on Wednesday. Timken shares are up more than 25 percent since Relational announced its stake and called for a breakup in November. That compares with a roughly 13 percent increase in the Standard and Poor's 500 index over the same period. Batchelder said that if shareholders support the proposal and Timken decides to disregard the vote, Relational would consider putting up a slate of board nominees at next year's annual meeting.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com TOP STORIES Barclays Taps an Insider to Repair Its Reputation  |  Barclays, which has been tarnished by scandal, appointed a new chief executive on Thursday, as the British bank looks to restore its reputation and overhaul its culture. By selecting Antony Jenkins, Barclays seemed to steal a line from the comedy series “Monty Python”: “And now for something completely different.” Mr. Jenkins, 51, an Oxford-educated Briton with a soft-spoken demeanor, started his career 30 years ago as a cashier at a local Barclays branch. Over the last three years, he has overseen the sleepy consumer retail and banking business at Barclays. In short, he has little in common with his predecessor, Robert E. Diamond. Mr. Diamond, an American-born investment banker, brought a hard-charging ethos to the bank, transforming it into a top player on Wall Street. But the culture of risk-taking also proved problematic. In July, Mr. Diamond resigned amid revelations that Barclays manipulated key interest rates for its own benefit.DealBook » As Barclays Retail Chief Rises, What of the Firm’s Investment Bank?  |  With the ascension of Antony Jenkins as Barclays’ new chief executive, attention will inevitably fall to the part of the British bank that has grown the fastest in recent years: its investment bank.DealBook » Romney Campaign Puts a Focus on Bain  |  Mitt Romney’s record at Bain Capital continues to be a focus — some might say the focus — of both his supporters and detractors.

The site features nine one- to two-minute videos, each highlighting a successful Bain deal. Two videos focus on the office-supplies retailer Staples, one of Mr. Romney’s most successful investments during his tenure at Bain.

		<content>For Modern Retirees, There’s No Place Like Home - NYTimes.com INFLUENCED by long-term trends in housing design, communications technology, medical care and the expectations of the largest retiree generation in United States history, the outlines of the next era of American retirement are gaining clarity across the country. In Parker, Colo., 18 miles south of Denver, retirees are proposing what they call a senior cohousing community in a downtown neighborhood. When completed, perhaps next year, it will have shared common spaces for activities and about 40 condominium-style apartments at affordable prices. In Boston, retirees in 2002 established a nonprofit service organization to provide rides, grocery shopping, repairs and social events for members of the nation’s first urban village. Today, according to the Village-to-Village network, a national alliance of such groups, 100  other urban, suburban and rural villages — networks defined by more than geography — have formed nationwide. Members typically pay annual dues of $400 to $600, and some seek to recruit residents who have specific interests in art or music, a trend illustrated in Dustin Hoffman’s 2012 film “Quartet.” The Parker and Boston projects reflect two of the most significant priorities that have consistently emerged in surveys of new retirees and adults who are approaching retirement: the desire to stay in one’s home as long as possible and the interest in living in big-city neighborhoods or suburban downtowns. “We’re seeing the development of housing networks and social networks and service networks that provide the activities and support for many more people to lead the lives they want in their homes,” said Paul B. Kusserow, senior vice president and chief strategy and corporate development officer for Humana, the large Recognizing the strength of that trend, which is developing in an era of rising energy costs and static incomes, cities are building new neighborhood infrastructure — transit lines, public markets, parks and denser housing — that is accessible without driving. Cincinnati and Grand Rapids, Mich., for instance, are among the dozens of small American cities that are building new rail and rapid bus transit lines that serve the growing number of young professionals, as well as middle-age and older residents moving to their downtowns. “Young people and old people are sharing some of the same values about neighborhood living,” said Armando Carbonell, chairman of planning and urban form at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a research group in Cambridge, Mass. “They share preferences in housing that are showing up in the market. It is a kind of living that is more central city, smaller units for smaller households.” Software developers and engineers say they are making it easier for people to stay in their homes — urban or suburban — by inventing sensors, audio and visual equipment, and communications devices to provide care remotely. Much of the data, video and sound is accessible online, enabling instant contact with residents, and providing peace of mind for friends and family. “In 20 years, many more people will stay in their homes who need help but don’t need to be in nursing care or assisted living,” said Casey Clements, the managing director of Rest Assured, which installs sensing and communications devices and assigns a trained staff member to provide what it calls telecare from its offices in Lafayette, Ind. Founded in 2006 as a division of ResCare, based in Louisville and one of the nation’s largest in-home care providers, Rest Assured serves 600 clients in 16 states for an average cost of $1,100 a month, Mr. Clements said. “Technology is changing in our favor,” he said. “Costs are coming down and these tools are already easy for clients to operate. We see many, many more people turning to this kind of system so that they can stay in their homes.” The goal of remaining at home also has attracted the interest of builders. In 2011, the Lennar Corporation, one of the country’s largest builders, began offering floor plans for new multigenerational suburban houses in California and Arizona that incorporate separate living quarters. The first-floor apartments — which include small kitchens — initially could be used by a boomerang college student or an aging parent, and then by a live-in caregiver.</content>

		<content>Barrick Gold to Buy Equinox Minerals for $7.8 Billion - NYTimes.com Mark Blinch/Reuters Aaron Regent, Barrick Gold’s chief executive, said the deal would help increase copper reserves. 7:05 p.m. | Updated Flush with cash from the commodities boom, the mining company Barrick Gold said on Monday that it had agreed to buy Equinox Minerals for $7.8 billion — a deal that expands Barrick’s presence in copper. The all-cash transaction is a 30 percent premium to Equinox’s price on Feb. 25, the last trading day before the company announced an unsolicited bid for the Lundin Mining Corporation. It is also 16 percent more than the $6.4 billion proposal this month from the Chinese mining company Minmetals Resources, which Equinox called a “lowball price.” “The acquisition of Equinox would add a high-quality, long-life asset to our portfolio, and is consistent with our strategy of increasing gold and copper reserves through exploration and acquisitions,” Aaron Regent, chief executive of Barrick, said in a statement, adding in a conference call that it was a way to “deploy a portion of our cash balances, which are earning very little.” Barrick is riding the extended rally in commodity prices, driven in part by the strong demand from emerging markets like China and India. Gold recently reached a new high of $1,518 an ounce, up from around $1,200 a year ago. Copper is up more than 40 percent over the same period. Article Tools Related Links Press release » The strength in the commodities market has encouraged cash-rich companies to make deals. The materials sector, which includes mining, has had $133 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions worldwide this year, compared with a volume of $57.5 billion for the same period in 2010, according to Thomson Reuters data. With the acquisition of Equinox, Barrick — which relies on gold for 80 percent of its revenues — would expand its business in copper, adding to the company’s interests in Chile. Its Lumwana project in Zambia is expected to account for 20 percent of the country’s copper production once it reaches full capacity. Last quarter, Equinox said that it sold 24,125 metric tons of copper from the project, down 9 percent from the year before. “It’s very rare that assets like this come on the market,” Mr. Regent said during the conference call. “If you look at the top 20 mines in the world, this is the only one that’s actually available.” Earnings for Barrick, which is set to report first-quarter results on Wednesday, rose 57 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the same period a year earlier. Over the last year, its share price has jumped 33 percent. The Equinox board has unanimously approved the Barrick deal and withdrawn its offer for Lundin. It is unclear whether Minmetals will come back with a higher offer. The company’s bid was unsolicited, rare for a Chinese player. Mr. Regent acknowledged on a conference call Monday that Barrick was still in a “competitive situation” in its bid for Equinox. Craig Williams, chief executive of Equinox, said in a statement that the Barrick offer was “superior to the public proposal made by Minmetals in terms of certainty and value.” A press official for Minmetals said the company would comment once it had studied the matter. Barrick will finance the acquisition with a bridge loan and credit facility worth $5 billion from Royal Bank of Canada and Morgan Stanley. The financing will supplement the company’s existing $1.5 billion loan facility and its $4 billion in cash reserves. Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada advised Barrick, while Ogilvy Renault, Sullivan and Cromwell and Clayton Utz were legal advisers. Equinox employed CIBC World Markets, Goldman Sachs and TD Securities as advisers and Hoskin and Harcourt as legal counsel.</content>

		<content>Deductive Reasoning Can Be a Dangerous Thing - NYTimes.com Ian Willms for The New York TimesToronto’s financial district. A recent case involving a Canadian investment banker raises an interesting question about whether a person’s own intuition about a merger constitutes illegal insider trading charge. The answer becomes even more difficult when two securities regulators reach different conclusions about whether there was any confidential information involved. The Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States and Canada’s Ontario Securities Commission filed separate cases against Richard Bruce Moore, who had worked at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. He agreed to settlements with each, paying about $850,000 and accepting restrictions on any future work in the securities industry. White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools The trading involved Tomkins, a British maker of car parts, before it received a takeover offer in July 2010 that led its stock price to rise nearly 30 percent. The circumstances by which Mr. Moore gathered the information about the offer make it hard to find any clear line that separates good deductive reasoning from illegal trading. At the time, one of Mr. Moore’s clients was the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, which was planning an offer for Tomkins along with a private equity firm. Mr. Moore regularly dealt with one of the pension plan’s senior representatives about providing investment banking services. He learned there was a significant transaction involving the pension board, but that C.I.B.C. would not be involved in it. Over the course of the next few months, Mr. Moore gleaned additional tidbits about the transaction from his interactions with the pension board representative. In this case, no one tipped him off about the deal, at least not in the traditional sense. In essence, he put two and two together after he saw the pension board representative speaking with someone at a charity event, and the representative refused to introduce them or even identify who he was speaking with. A short time later, another person identified the unknown person as the chief executive of Tomkins. Having figured out the likely target of the deal, the next day Mr. Moore started buying Tomkins stock through an offshore account, ultimately putting approximately one-third of his net worth into its shares. His trades included buying American depositary receipts in the company that were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, which gave the S.E.C. jurisdiction over the case. Under United States law, the so-called misappropriation theory of insider trading requires proof that a defendant took information from a party to whom he owed a fiduciary duty and then converted it to his own use by trading. In its complaint, the S.E.C. claimed that by pulling together different strands of information about the impending deal from a client, Mr. Moore “misappropriated that information from his employer by purchasing Tomkins securities.” The Ontario Securities Commission, however, took a different path in concluding that Mr. Moore traded improperly in Tomkins shares. In its settlement with Mr. Moore, it stated that at no time did the pension board representative “ever provide Moore with any material, generally undisclosed information.” Instead, the regulator said he “ought not to have made use of information obtained in part by virtue of his position as an employee of a registrant prior to its general disclosure to the public.” In doing so, the commission said, Mr. Moore acted “contrary to the public interest.” Unlike the S.E.C., the Ontario commission did not find that he engaged in insider trading, but only that he acted inappropriately given his position in the securities industry. This is in part a result of a limitation in Section 76 of the Ontario Securities Act, which requires that a defendant be “in a special relationship with a reporting issuer” when trading in its securities to violate the law. Was the information on which Mr. Moore traded really a breach of a fiduciary duty to C.I.B.C. under the misappropriation theory? The transactions have many hallmarks of insider trading: a quick purchase of shares shortly after gaining information, resulting in a quick profit. Moreover, this is the type of “all in” bet involving a significant amount of a defendant’s net worth that shows a belief that the information was quite valuable. Add to that Mr. Moore’s position in the securities industry, and this seems to add up to an insider trading case. Yet, Mr. Moore did not obtain any confidential information from a source at the pension board about the Tomkins offer, as the Canadian authorities make clear. Seeing someone at an event and making deductions based on circumspect conduct about the identity of a corporate executive is hardly the type of confidential information normally identified as the basis for an insider trading charge. Nor did Mr. Moore use information provided to C.I.B.C. for his trading because the bank was not a participant in the transaction. The only basis on which one could say that Mr. Moore misused his employer’s confidential information would be to use the legal fiction that everything he knew was attributable to his employer and therefore his use of it somehow resulted in a breach of fiduciary duty. In other words, he misappropriated the information from himself. While that is a pretty convoluted theory of insider trading, it looks as if the S.E.C. is saying that using your job to deduce something going on at another company that is your client can be enough to violate the insider trading prohibition. In a sense, the S.E.C. seems to be applying the theory of “if it quacks like a duck” then it must be insider trading. To add another layer to the intrigue, Mr. Moore’s settlement with the Ontario commission included a description of real insider trading when he bought shares in a different company that was being advised by an investment bank where he was working after leaving C.I.B.C. His apparent willingness to abuse his position would have made it difficult to defend charges related to his trading in Tomkins. The S.E.C.’s case shows that it continues to take an aggressive approach to insider trading, pushing the limits of when transactions based on a person’s special access to important information can be enough to pursue charges. The deduction should be fairly simple: be very careful when you figure out something about a company and then try to take advantage of it by going all in to generate a quick profit. Peter J.

		<content>As Airgas Meeting Nears, Deal Battle Continues - NYTimes.com Article Tools With Airgas‘s shareholder meeting nearing — it’s scheduled for Sept. 15 — the battle between the industrial gases company and its unwanted solicitor, Air Products and Chemicals, is heating up. The latest shot came on Thursday, when Air Products sent a letter to Airgas’s board, arguing that some of the target company’s defenses have fallen by the wayside in light of recent developments. Chief among these is Air Products’ obtaining a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, securing regulatory approval of a merger if certain assets are sold. The letter seeks to point out various purported contradictions between Airgas’s statements earlier in the year and more recent comments from the company. Air Products’s chief executive, John E. McGlade, wrote that where before Airgas deemed regulatory approval of any deal uncertain, earlier this week it called the F.T.C.’s decision “widely anticipated.” “Airgas has continually suggested that shareholders’ realization of value will be delayed—but with our fully financed all-cash offer, and our execution of a Consent Decree with the Staff of the Federal Trade Commission, any further delay in completing this transaction is due solely to the Airgas Board,” Mr. McGlade wrote in the letter. After reaching the agreement with the F.T.C., Air Products extended its tender offer for Airgas shares of $63.50 to Oct. 29. Air Products added that as of Aug. 4, about 23 percent of Airgas shareholders had tendered their bids. That said, Airgas’s shares closed at $66.25 on Thursday. Airgas has argued that Air Products’ offer remains undervalued. “We are pleased that holders of nearly 80% of Airgas shares have chosen not to tender, notwithstanding Air Products’ intensive efforts to get Airgas stockholders to tender by the August 13, 2010, expiration date,” Airgas said in a statement on Monday. The important next fight will come at the Sept. 15 meeting, at which Air Products is seeking to gain three board seats. 19 August 2010 Board of Directors Airgas, Inc. 259 North Radnor-Chester Road Suite 100 Radnor, PA 19087-5283 Directors: As the September 15 Annual Meeting approaches, we believe Airgas shareholders will judge the credibility of the incumbent Board in discharging its fiduciary duty of candor to shareholders. The Airgas statements below are just a few of many which run directly to the candor of the Board with shareholders and the credibility of its objections to our offer. Airgas has continually suggested that shareholders’ realization of value will be delayed—but with our fully financed all-cash offer, and our execution of a Consent Decree with the Staff of the Federal Trade Commission, any further delay in completing this transaction is due solely to the Airgas Board. On Regulatory Approval: Then… “[Air Products] ignores . . . the regulatory issues that . . . would slow the process considerably.” Letter from Peter McCausland to John McGlade, December 8, 2009 “[R]egulatory concerns . . . create significant uncertainty as to when—if ever—Airgas stockholders would receive consideration under the Offer.” Airgas 14D-9, February 22, 2010 “[The] regulatory risks are significant.” Airgas Revised Preliminary Proxy Statement, July 8, 2010 “[T]he antitrust regulatory authorities would be likely to require in connection with any approval that Air Products agree to divest substantial assets or businesses . . . . The timing of any such approval . . . impose[s] uncertainty . . . .” Airgas 14D-9, July 21, 2010 Now… Air Products’ Consent Decree was “widely anticipated.” Airgas Press Release, August 16, 2010 On Timing: Then… “The offer is highly uncertain and any payments made to Airgas stockholders would be considerably deferred.” Airgas Press Release, February 22, 2010 “[A]ny comparison of the ‘current’ value which Air Products claims to be offering . . . must take into account . . . the time value of money . . . .” Airgas 14D-9, February 22, 2010 “[T]he Offer is highly uncertain and would require a significant amount of time to complete, even under the most favorable circumstances.” Airgas 14D-9, July 21, 2010 Now… Air Products has agreed with the Staff of the Federal Trade Commission on a consent decree that would resolve any regulatory issues. The only remaining hurdles to prompt completion of the offer are within the control of the Airgas Board. Airgas Board’s response: None For more than 10 months, Air Products has attempted to engage the Airgas Board in discussions. We have proceeded with our offer because of the undeniable logic of this combination, with its clear benefits for the shareholders, customers, and employees of both companies. On September 15, your shareholders have an important decision to make—one we believe will be heavily influenced by their judgment of whether the incumbent Airgas Board has been honest with them and is acting in their interests by refusing to negotiate with Air Products. We urge you once again to reconsider your position with respect to our offer. Very truly yours, /s/ John E. McGlade Go to Air Products Press Release via PR Newswire »</content>

		<content>No Tweets for Me, Buffett's Second-In-Command Says - NYTimes.com A day after Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett set up his own account on Twitter, his second-in-command, Charlie Munger, said he has no plans to follow the legendary investor's lead. Buffett, 82, launched his "@WarrenBuffett" account with the tweet "Warren is in the house," and immediately started adding followers at the rate of 1,000 per minute. But the 89-year-old Munger - renowned for his forthright style of speaking - suggested fans should not look forward to seeing his trademark remarks in 140-character form any time soon. "No, certainly not," Munger said in an interview, after being asked whether he planned to join the social media network. "That's not my milieu. I don't like too many things going on at once." It marks a rare point of departure between Buffett and Munger, who have worked together at Berkshire for decades. "We have practically no disagreements. That's just the way the chemistry has worked," Munger said, commenting on his working relationship with Buffett. "People who think we're quite a diverse pair, and that one is helping the other - it's more like two twins, and one of them is a little more able than the other."

		<content>3M 1Q Net Flat on Soft Demand - Cuts 2013 Guidance - NYTimes.com MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — 3M said Thursday its first-quarter profit barely rose as it faced weaker demand. It cut its profit guidance for the full year. 3M's Scotch tape and construction and safety materials make it a good window into the broader economy. It has operations all over the world, so a stronger dollar hurt its revenue because many of its goods are sold in other currencies. "While there are some indications of an upturn later in the year, our optimism is tempered by the current reality, said Inge G. Thulin, 3M's chairman, president, and CEO, on a conference call. "We expected a challenging start to the year, but, in fact, market conditions were tougher than we expected." Net income for Maplewood, Minn.-based 3M Co.'s was just slightly higher from a year ago at $1.13 billion, or $1.61 per share. A year ago its net income worked out to $1.59 per share. Revenue rose 2 percent to $7.63 billion. Revenue and profits were both short of analyst expectations of $1.65 per share and revenue of $7.81 billion. The cut to its full-year profit guidance was driven by the stronger U.S. dollar and uncertainty in Japan and Western Europe. For the full year, it now expects to earn $6.60 to $6.85 per share. It had previously predicted $6.70 to $6.95. Analysts had been expecting a profit of $6.83 per share, according to FactSet. Half of the profit reduction is because of the impact of foreign currencies, and half is because of tougher business conditions, the company said. It didn't make a specific revenue prediction, but said currency issues will reduce revenue by 1.5 percent, whereas previously it had expected no impact from currency. Operating profits in its industrial division — the company's biggest by revenue — fell almost 3 percent to $576 million. Profits rose slightly in its safety and graphics and health care divisions, and dropped 16 percent in its electronics and energy division as revenue declined. Operating profits were flat in its consumer division, where products include Scotch tape and Post-it notes. Automatic government spending cuts that took effect last month are expected to cut $10 million to $20 million from revenue for the year, the company said. 3M gets about $1 billion in revenue from the government. Its Ceradyne ceramics unit, acquired late last year, makes the bullet-stopping inserts for body armor used by U.S. troops. That business is in decline as the U.S. shrinks its presence in Afghanistan, but it's being partially replaced by a contract to supply armor for the Afghan government, the company said. Earlier this month 3M said it would lay off 93 workers in Kentucky because of the slowdown. 3M shares dropped $2.99, or 2.8 percent, to close at $104.88 Thursday. 3M is one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average, and the shares had been near their 52-week high of $108.72.</content>

		<content>New Tax Laws Cover Cost Basis of Investments - NYTimes.com , research director at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc. in Columbia, Md., said that most investors would probably prefer to either sell the highest- or lowest-cost investments first, depending on their goals. The highest cost method is a classic attempt to minimize your tax bill because you are selling positions with the biggest losses first, then shares with smaller losses, then the smallest gains, and lastly the biggest gains, he said. Conversely, if you sell the shares with the lowest cost basis first, he said you were going to take the biggest gains first, then smaller gains, then the smallest losses, and then the biggest losses. That method might seem counterintuitive, but would make sense for investors expecting their capital gains tax rate to rise, he added, because they might fall into a higher tax bracket in the future. (He points out that married couples with $72,500 of income or less, after deductions, are eligible for the zero percent capital gains rate, so harvesting gains is a better option.) Finally, there’s another wrinkle to the new rules: brokers are also required to report what’s known as wash sales on securities covered by the new regulations. That is when you sell a security at a loss and buy substantially the same investment within 30 days before or after the initial sale. (The firms will only be required to report wash sales within the same account, even though they are not allowed across all accounts. If it occurs elsewhere, it is up to you to report.) It’s easy to inadvertently run afoul of these rules if you’re automatically putting money into similar investments in other accounts, or you’re reinvesting dividends. And if you do, that means you won’t be able to take the deduction, experts said, at least for now. , and some provide detailed instructions on how to change your cost basis method for subsequent sales (though, if you already sold mutual funds using the average cost method, you must stick with that strategy for remaining shares, Mr. Kitces said. But you could use a different method for new purchases). The good news is that if you decide to change brokers, they are now required to to send your cost basis data to the new firm within 13 days, according to Schwab, so long as they have that information. And many firms may already keep track of your basis, even if they are not required to send it to the I.R.S. Meanwhile, as a result of the new rules, the I.R.S. updated the relevant tax forms and added a new one. The , the tax form sent by your broker that summarizes the proceeds from the sale of your investments, will now include your cost basis, sale price and the date you acquired the shares. Make sure that there are no errors and that the information matches your records. You will still need to transfer that information to the Schedule D, a form you submit with your overall federal tax return, but now you will also have to fill out a new , where you must list individual transactions (and you’ll need to fill out a separate 8949 for investments that are covered by the new rules, and another one for investments that are not, according to Mr. Kitces). You can expect to hear from the I.R.S.,  he said, if your figures don’t match its records. “Before the new rule, the I.R.S. had no clue what my basis was,” Professor Cooke said. “It had no idea what I paid for it and relied on the investor to be honest. Now, there is no wiggle room.” The Your Money column on Saturday, about the automating of calculations on capital gains and losses from stock sales, misstated the time elapsed if one had bought shares of bank stock in August 1980 and had reinvested the dividends since then. It is almost 33 years, not 13 years. The column also referred incorrectly to a predecessor of the current Bank of America. In 1980, it was known as NCNB Corporation — not as NationsBank, a name it did not adopt until 1991.</content>

		<content>Some Retailers Rethink Their Role in Bangladesh - NYTimes.com Ever since a building with garment factories collapsed in Bangladesh last week, killing more than 400 people, Western apparel companies with ties to the country have scrambled to address public concerns about working conditions there. Benetton repeatedly revised its accounts of goods produced at one of the factories, while officials at and other retailers huddled to figure out how to improve conditions, and some debated whether to remain in Bangladesh at all. At least one big American company, however, had already decided to leave the country — pushed by the last devastating disaster, a fire just six months ago that killed 112 people. , considered the world’s largest licenser with sales of nearly $40 billion, in March ordered an end to the production of branded merchandise in Bangladesh. A Disney official told The New York Times on Wednesday that the company had sent a letter to thousands of licensees and vendors on March 4 setting out new rules for overseas production. Less than 1 percent of the factories used by Disney’s contractors are in Bangladesh, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The company’s efforts had accelerated because of the November fire at a factory that labor advocates asserted had made Disney apparel. The Disney ban also extends to other countries, including Pakistan, where a fire last September killed 262 garment workers. Disney’s move reflects the difficult calculus that companies with operations in countries like Bangladesh are facing as they balance profit and reputation against the backdrop of a wrenching human disaster. Bangladesh has some of the lowest wages in the world, its government is eager to lure Western companies and their jobs, and many labor groups want those big corporations to stay to improve conditions, not cut their losses and run. “These are complicated global issues and there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution,” said Bob Chapek, president of Disney Consumer Products. “Disney is a publicly held company accountable to its shareholders, and after much thought and discussion we felt this was the most responsible way to manage the challenges associated with our supply chain.” , Gap, Carrefour and Li and Fung, met near Frankfurt with representatives from the German government and nongovernment organizations to try to negotiate a plan to ensure safety at the more than 4,000 garment factories in Bangladesh. With 3.6 million garment workers and more than $18 billion in apparel exports last year, Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest apparel exporter after China. Walmart, Gap and other companies said on Wednesday that they were already taking action, including paying for Bangladesh factory managers to be trained in fire safety. But labor advocacy groups are pushing them to do more, especially to help finance factory improvements like fire escapes. “Companies feel tremendous pressure now,” said Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a factory-monitoring group based in Washington. “The apparel brands and retailers face a greater level of reputation risk of being associated with abusive and dangerous conditions in Bangladesh than ever before.” On Wednesday, thousands of people continued to gather around the collapsed Rana Plaza building in Savar, a suburb of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s capital. As emergency personnel dug through the rubble for yet another day, many relatives of the missing carried signs, holding out diminishing hope that a loved one would be found. A mass burial of unclaimed bodies was conducted as the death count climbed above 400. In Rome, Pope Francis voiced sympathy for Bangladeshi garment workers on Wednesday, saying he was shocked to learn that many of them earned just $40 a month. “This is called slave labor,” he said.</content>

		<content>For Some Dead Brands, a Tortuous Path to Resurrection - NYTimes.com Mariners’ MuseumThe boat manufacturer Chris-Craft was once known for its wooden designs. After languishing for years, the brand was revived by an investment firm. At a time when bankruptcy auctions are filled with sad tales of beleaguered brands, snagging a well-known name for pennies on the dollar can seem like a sure bet for ambitious investors. Yet, as Stephen F. Heese and Stephen M. Julius describe, buying the rights to a name and restarting operations requires years of dedication. The two, who were classmates at Harvard Business School in the 1980s, manage their own capital at Stellican, an investment firm. Their goal: to seek out so-called heritage brands — those remembered for their high quality and authenticity — and rebuild a company. One project is the revival of Chris-Craft, once the largest pleasure boat manufacturer in the United States. The notion of buying and resurrecting a beloved brand can be appealing across product categories, as reflected by the current bidding dance for Hostess or the woefully long ordeal of Saab, which was sold to Chinese and Japanese investors last year. Chris-Craft, which Stellican now operates, was known for its meticulous design and use of wood and chrome. Its boats were widely sought after and associated with the many celebrities and public figures who owned them, including Katharine Hepburn, Frank Sinatra and Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. That image made it appealing to Stellican’s principals. Article Tools Yet, while nostalgia can be a powerful marketing tool, business school case studies are filled with would-be white knights that needed more than money to succeed. For example, Excelsior Henderson, a motorcycle maker twice rescued from bankruptcy, ultimately failed. Yet, Triumph Motorcycles was revived in 1984 and has operated since. “Brands are not like tech start-ups where there is a template — X number of years to prototype, X number of years to harvest,” said Nancy F. Koehn, a Harvard Business School professor. “A big piece of it is art; there’s an alchemy to it.” The death and rebirth of Chris-Craft played out over decades. The company was founded by Christopher Columbus Smith, who built his first vessel in 1874 and soon developed a reputation as a master. The Smith family sold Chris-Craft in 1960, around the time fiberglass began displacing wood as the material of choice for boats. By 1968, Chris-Craft had been sold to the media mogul Herb Siegel. It stopped making wood boats, and expanded beyond powerboats, adding sailboats and houseboats to its offerings. Market share and profits declined. Enter Stellican. Mr. Julius, with assistance from Mr. Heese, had previously resuscitated Riva, a premium Italian boat maker, in 1998. He sold it to the Italian yacht company Ferretti Group in 2000. Before joining forces for the Riva deal, Mr. Julius and Mr. Heese took different paths after Harvard. Mr. Julius started his career with the Boston Consulting Group and eventually moved to London. Mr. Heese, a certified public accountant by training, headed to what was then Price Waterhouse and later to the Erico International Corporation, a privately held manufacturer of electrical and mechanical hardware. In 1991, Mr. Julius formed Stellican as an advisory and investment vehicle for his family’s assets. In 1998, while living in Italy, he called Mr. Heese, who was in the United States, to ask if he could help set up distribution in the United States for Riva. Mr. Heese officially joined Stellican in 2001, and the partners began work on the Chris-Craft deal. Although the two would not discuss their firm’s financial returns, they say they expect internal return rates higher than 35 percent on their investments. Stellican owns no more than two companies at once, and typically has an investment ceiling of $10 million. “We put all our eggs in one or two baskets,” Mr. Julius said. Chris-Craft’s path to revival was tortuous. In 1981, the Chris-Craft boatyard was bought by G. Dale Murray, but Mr. Siegel retained rights to the Chris-Craft name. Mr. Murray’s company went bankrupt in 1988, and was bought by the Outboard Marine Corporation, which sold several brands of boats as well as outboard engines, before going bankrupt in 2001. After Mr. Heese read about the bankruptcy, he contacted Mr. Julius. Stellican acquired the assets of Chris-Craft (finished and unfinished boats) and the trademark for the name in separate transactions. The complicated process of acquiring the assets included a 12-hour, 20-way auction held in a conference room at the Chicago office of the law firm Skadden, Arps, Meagher, Slate and Flom. Four hundred industry players gathered, all competing for the Chris-Craft assets. Mr. Julius, bidding on behalf of Stellican, lost out to the owner of Genmar Industries, Irwin Jacobs, who had teamed up with Bombardier to buy all of Outboard Marine’s assets for $95 million. As he left the room, Mr. Julius told Mr. Jacobs to call him if he ever wanted to sell Chris-Craft. That call came just days later. In March 2001, Stellican bought the Chris-Craft assets from Genmar for $5 million. Acquiring the Chris-Craft name, which was still owned by Mr. Siegel, was next. But Mr. Siegel refused to sell the name rights to Stellican. So, when Mr. Julius learned Mr. Siegel was in the process of selling his media company, Chris-Craft Industries, to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, he approached Mr. Murdoch directly. They reached a deal that enabled Stellican to buy the brand for $5 million. Restarting operations was a bit more daunting. During the decades when Chris-Craft languished, its products had become middle market, Mr. Julius said. Scrapping the old product line was Stellican’s first order of business. “It was always, ‘I remember,’ followed by a smile and a positive memory,” he said. Chris-Craft evoked the innocence and promise of post-World War II America — and Henry Fonda piloting a 1950s model in “On Golden Pond.” Building products that fulfilled that promise became their mantra, Mr. Heese said. Restoring Chris-Craft also required rebuilding its dealer network. Mr. Julius said that dealers were initially skeptical that the type of customer he described — one obsessed with beauty and performance, not price — existed. The company makes 20- to 36-foot boats whose prices range from about $50,000 to $550,000. He had to sell his products to dealers and feel comfortable they could sell them to customers. Cost control also remained important, a role falling to Mr. Heese, who signs every check as chief executive. “We’re very hard-nosed when it comes to investing our own money,” he said. Chris-Craft continues to bolster its dealer network worldwide. In June, the company plans to release a line of Chris-Craft branded sports apparel for a wider market. The company just signed a deal with IMG, which will serve as its licensing agent for watches, sunglasses and toys. After starting at zero, Chris-Craft sales were $32 million in 2012. Its high was $60 million in 2008. In between, Stellican bought Indian Motorcycles in 2006, turned it around, and sold it to Polaris Industries in 2011. The partners acknowledge that their efforts may not have worked at a traditional private equity firm, most of which seek companies with positive cash flows. Product innovation separates the winners from the losers when it comes to brand revivals, said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University. “Brands lose value because they get fat, dumb and happy,” he said. Although Stellican has received attractive offers for Chris-Craft, it plans to hold onto it for now. Mr. Heese said he was in no hurry to begin chasing deals again, a process he described as “gut-wrenching.” “When you’re buying a company that’s in bankruptcy, you’re sitting across from people who screwed up,” Mr. Heese said. “They’re not dumb — they just got one thing wrong,” he said.

		<content>In Goldman Sachs's Retreat From I.P.O., a Signal to Investors - NYTimes.com Harry Campbell When Goldman Sachs fires you as a client, you probably have a problem. That appears to have happened last month, when Goldman withdrew as the lead underwriter for the initial public offering of the Russian cellphone operator MegaFon on the London Stock Exchange. The multibillion-dollar offering, the largest I.P.O. since Facebook, is nonetheless hurtling forward, highlighting a flawed system. MegaFon is the second-largest mobile phone operator in Russia, with about 63 million customers, behind Mobile TeleSystems and ahead of Vimpelcom, both of which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. MegaFon is controlled by one of Russia’s richest men, Alisher Usmanov, who is well connected with the Kremlin and has interests around the globe. (For one thing, he controls a roughly 29 percent stake in the London soccer team Arsenal.) Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools The I.P.O. is happening largely as a result of a battle for control between Mr. Usmanov and two other big shareholders, TeliaSonera, the Stockholm-based telecommunications giant, and Alfa-Bank, the large financial conglomerate controlled by another Russian billionaire, Mikhail Fridman. A settlement among the warring parties was reached in April, with Alfa selling its 25 percent interest in MegaFon for $5.2 billion to Mr. Usmanov and his associates and TeliaSonera shedding part of its stake. The London offering is meant for TeliaSonera to sell down its stake to around 25 percent from 37.5 percent. Mr. Usmanov would then control 50 percent and one share of MegaFon. After the I.P.O., about 15 percent of the company’s shares will be held by the public. The offering hit a road bump in October, when Goldman withdrew as the lead underwriter, giving up tens of millions of dollars in potential fees. The firm did not publicly disclose its reason, but a person close to the transaction said that Goldman withdrew because Mr. Usmanov wanted to place his controlling ownership in a holding company with his other investments, including his Arsenal stake and the ore mining company Metalloinvest. The problem was that the holding company would be owned by Mr. Usmanov and Farhad Moshiri, who co-owns Usmanov’s Arsenal stake, and Vladimir Skoch, the father of Andrei Skoch, a prominent Russian oligarch and member of the Russian parliament who also owns part of Metalloinvest. Goldman felt that it did not have enough time to scrutinize the structure, and so it withdrew, according to this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. From the beginning of the I.P.O. process, there had been worries that a publicly held MegaFon would be controlled by elements other than Mr. Usmanov. This concern is typical in Russia, because the country has a weak rule of law, share ownership is murky and controlling shareholders have not been shy about leveraging their political power to shove out pesky minority owners. Mr. Usmanov is a reflection of this world. An extremely successful businessman, Mr. Usmanov was imprisoned in Uzbekistan for six years after being convicted on charges of corruption in the 1980s. Mr. Usmanov strongly contends that the charges and imprisonment were trumped up and politically motivated. And false imprisonment was certainly something that happened during Soviet rule.(A Soviet court expunged his criminal record in 1989. The Supreme Court of Uzbekistan overturned the original conviction in 2000.) But the new structure and the uncertainty about doing business in Russia, and the always looming issue of political involvement, may well have persuaded Goldman to withdraw. When asked about these issues, MegaFon declined to comment, citing legal restrictions in the United States relating to publicity for the offering. It may turn out that the concerns over MegaFon amount to much of nothing. Indeed, after Goldman’s pullout, Mr. Usmanov announced that he would maintain voting control of the holding company, an announcement that was probably intended to satisfy people concerned with the corporate governance aspect of this deal. Earlier this week, the company announced that Paul Myners, a former British Treasury minister, would join the board, further beefing up its governance. Still, it is telling that when Goldman dropped out, none of the other underwriters followed suit. The I.P.O., now scheduled for the end of this month, has been delayed for a few weeks, but Morgan Stanley and Sberbank CIB continue as lead underwriters. Citigroup, Credit Suisse and VTB are also part of the syndicate. The only real holdup appears to be a more extended review by the British listing authority. This is no surprise. There is always a prominent bank willing to step into any deal. But this is not how the market is supposed to work. Underwriters are meant to vet clients and work only on offerings that make sense. This duty has been diluted over the years, to the extent it ever existed, by the willingness of investors to overlook a company’s flaws and invest in the next hot issue. And so banks have blindly followed heed, failing to fulfill their gatekeeping responsibilities. There are plenty of other examples. Take the Facebook offering. Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter, appeared unwilling to push back on its prominent client, and the market became overstuffed with Facebook shares. And how else to explain I.P.O. disasters like Caesars Entertainment, which went public in February at $9 a share, closed that day at $15.39 and is now worth less than $5 a share? The company had too much debt for the public markets, but Credit Suisse and Citigroup, the lead underwriters, still sold it. Earlier, there was the dot-com bubble. I could go on. And that is why the Goldman withdrawal is a big deal. That a big bank would pull out indicates that someone on Wall Street is starting to have qualms about what gets taken to market these days. There may just be a recognition by Goldman, however belated, that underwriting means something more than simply selling anything it can. MegaFon is attractive to investors because it is a growth company and promises to pay a dividend with a 7 to 8 percent yield, an extraordinarily high rate of return in today’s low interest-rate environment. Investors may overlook the corporate governance risks and rush to buy shares like lemmings over the proverbial cliff. Given what’s happened over the last decade, no one would really be surprised that once again, investors sometimes can’t help themselves. And, if so, we may also be asking again, where were the gatekeepers? Steven M. Davidoff, a professor at the Michael E. Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University, is the author of “Gods at War: Shotgun Takeovers, Government by Deal and the Private Equity Implosion.” E-mail: dealprof@nytimes.com | Twitter: @StevenDavidoff This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: November 23, 2012 The Deal Professor column on Wednesday, about the planned initial public offering of MegaFon, a Russian cellphone operator controlled by Alisher Usmanov, referred incompletely to events after Mr. Usmanov’s conviction in the former Soviet Union on charges of corruption in the 1980s. While a Soviet court expunged Mr. Usmanov’s criminal record in 1989, after he had been imprisoned for six years, the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan also overturned the original conviction in 2000.

		<content>Stock Markets Recover Some Losses - NYTimes.com Better news on home sales and improved prospects for job growth sent stocks higher on Wall Street on Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 136 points, nearly making up its 140-point loss from the day before. The Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index edged back into the black for 2011, with just one day of trading left in the year. fell to a three-and-a-half-year low, an indication that hiring could pick up. Also, the number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes in November rose more than 7 percent to the highest level in a year and a half, according to the National Association of Realtors. Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial’s market strategist, said the reports were encouraging signals for the economy going in to 2012. “The correlation between jobs and housing has been crystal-clear this year,” Ms. Krosby said. “Parts of the country where jobs are more plentiful are the ones where the housing market has held up.” She said that the correlation became more pronounced after the real estate bust, when lenders became reluctant to even consider customers for a mortgage unless they held jobs. For instance, Boston’s 1.1 percent drop in home prices since last year was one of the lowest among metro areas tracked by S.and P./Case-Shiller index. The city’s unemployment rate is 6.2 percent, much lower than the national average of 8.6 percent. The positive housing news sent the stocks of home builders sharply higher. Masco Corporation rose 8.4 percent and PulteGroup rose 6 percent. The Dow closed at 12,287.04, a gain of 135.63 points, or 1.1 percent. For the year, the Dow is up 709 points, or 6 percent. The S.and P. 500 rose 13.38 points, or 1.07 percent, to 1,263.02. That is just six points above where the index started the year. Chesapeake Midstream Partners, a natural gas systems operator, rose 5 percent after it agreed to acquire Chesapeake Energy’s pipeline business. The euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar in more than a year and its lowest against the Japanese yen in a decade. The euro went as low as $1.28 versus the dollar, its weakest since September 2010. Investors continued to be worried that Italy’s 10-year borrowing rate remained uncomfortably close to 7 percent, a level that economists consider unsustainable. Greece, Ireland and Portugal all had to seek relief from their creditors after their 10-year bond yields rose above 7 percent. Italy paid 6.98 percent on a 10-year bond auction where it raised $3.3 billion. That was lower than the 7.56 percent it had to pay at an equivalent auction last month, but not low enough to assuage investors. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 6/32, to 100 29/32. The yield fell to 1.90 percent, from 1.92 percent late Wednesday.</content>

		<content>Moody's Warns Jefferies on 'Excessive' Pay - NYTimes.com The $78 million compensation package that the Jefferies Group doled out to its top executives raised more than a few eyebrows — including those at Moody’s Investors Service. The credit rating agency said in a note on Monday that it regarded the paychecks awarded to the top managers — its chief executive, Richard B. Handler, and its executive committee chairman, Brian Friedman — as a potentially ominous event for bondholders. (In Moody’s words, “credit negative,” meaning that the pay could contribute to a downgrade of the investment bank’s debt rating.) Mr. Handler’s pay in particular drew a lot of attention. He earned about $19 million last year, including a $5 million cash bonus and a $13 million long-term equity incentive award. And he had the chance to earn about $39 million in restricted stock through 2015 if he met certain performance targets. Article Tools To Moody’s, the high pay is a reminder of “excessive compensation” among Wall Street firms, potentially leading investment banks to take excessive risks and irritating critics on Capitol Hill and among regulators. Though Jefferies has performed well, largely avoiding the pitfalls that befell some of its bigger competitors, the high pay presents a few specific problems. It reinforces the idea that the firm’s strong performance rests with a few “key men,” whose departures could be disastrous. And it sends a reminder that the investment bank has not taken steps to ensure that employees will not suffer consequences from excessive risk-taking. “While Jefferies has outperformed its peers, an excessive focus on short-term compensation has been at the root of many outsized trading, credit and litigation losses at investment banks,” the Moody’s analysts wrote. They added that the firm has not put in place measures like longer award vesting periods and more expansive powers to claw back compensation. A Jefferies spokesman declined to comment on Monday. But the firm noted in its annual report last week that Mr. Handler and Mr. Friedman voluntarily returned some of their bonuses for 2012, as they have for the last few years. Mr. Handler’s job will expand once he becomes chief executive of the Leucadia National Corporation, which agreed to buy Jefferies in a $3.6 billion deal. Shares in Jefferies were up slightly in midday trading on Monday, at $19.99.</content>

		<content>Morgan Stanley Is Expected to Be a Focus at Galleon Trial - NYTimes.com Article Tools Goldman Sachs had the starring role last week in the insider trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam when its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, testified about a former Goldman director who had possibly leaked confidential information to Mr. Rajaratnam. Next up, Morgan Stanley. Adam Smith, a former portfolio manager at the Galleon Group, the hedge fund Mr. Rajaratnam ran, is expected to take the witness stand as soon as Monday and tell the jury that he obtained illegal tips about merger deals from a Morgan Stanley investment banker. Then, Mr. Smith is expected to say, he and Mr. Rajaratnam earned substantial profits by trading on the information. Mr. Smith pleaded guilty in January to insider trading and is cooperating with the government. He will be the first former Galleon employee to testify in the trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, which begins its fourth week on Monday. His testimony is expected to illuminate the culture inside Galleon, which was one of the world’s largest and most powerful hedge funds before Mr. Rajaratnam’s arrest in October 2009. Galleon, which focused on technology stocks, practiced the so-called mosaic theory of stock investing, which relies on analysts to ferret out data about companies by aggressively pressing sources for information to build a mosaic about those companies and gain an investment edge. Mr. Smith, in effect, has admitted that pieces of his mosaics came from illegal stock tips. A graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Business School, Mr. Smith, 38, was an investment banker in Morgan Stanley’s Silicon Valley office before joining Galleon in 2003. Galleon was a perfect fit for Mr. Smith, who specialized in the technology industry and preferred the fast-moving trading culture of a hedge fund to the slower-paced world of investment banking. A popular figure on the trading floor with a keen sense of humor, Mr. Smith thrived at Galleon, which at its height managed $7 billion. Mr. Rajaratnam took to Mr. Smith early on and gave him his own pool of money to manage, according to two people who had been close to him and would speak only on the condition of anonymity. At his peak, Mr. Smith controlled about $250 million. In his best years, he earned several million dollars annually. He was among the firm’s hardest workers, taking frequent trips to Asia to visit sources and production facilities. Mr. Smith has also admitted to obtaining the confidential financial results of two technology companies — the Intersil Corporation and Nvidia — from employees at those companies and then trading on the information in advance of their quarterly earnings announcements. His relationship with a former Morgan Stanley colleague, Kamal Ahmed, is expected to be a focus of his testimony. Mr. Ahmed is a Morgan Stanley managing director who is said to have provided Mr. Smith with information about pending deals, including Integrated Device Technology’s acquisition of Integrated Circuit Systems in 2005 and Advanced Micro Devices’ purchase of ATI Technologies the next year. Earlier in the trial, the government played a secretly recorded telephone call from 2008 in which Mr. Smith can be heard telling Mr. Rajaratnam about a potential sale involving Vishay Intertechnology. Mr. Smith says, “Listen, ah, I talked to Kamal last night” and explains that Morgan Stanley had tried to win the assignment to sell Vishay but that another bank “got the mandate.” He then says that he is going to buy some Vishay stock. On the call, Mr. Rajaratnam asks Mr. Smith how the market is treating him and Mr. Smith responds: “Like a baby treats a diaper.” Morgan Stanley has placed Mr. Ahmed on administrative leave. Doug Tween, a lawyer for Mr. Ahmed, said his client was cooperating and “we remain confident that he did nothing illegal or improper.” Mr. Rajaratnam’s lawyers are expected to portray Mr. Smith as untrustworthy and to argue that he is testifying in return for a lenient prison sentence. Just weeks before the trial began, prosecutors also tried to use Mr. Smith to gather information on Ian Horowitz, Mr. Rajaratnam’s personal trader at Galleon. On Jan. 14, after he began cooperating with the government, Mr. Smith made three secretly recorded calls to Mr. Horowitz in which he tried to elicit evidence of insider trading. At the end of the third call, Mr. Horowitz, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, said to Mr. Smith: “The questions you are asking me are like you are tapping me on the phone trying to get me to say some things.” “Are you serious?” Mr. Smith said, denying that he was recording their call. “Dude, come on.”</content>

		<content>A Curious Case of Insider Trading - NYTimes.com Article Tools Peter J. Henning follows issues involving securities law and white-collar crime for DealBook’s White Collar Watch. The Securities and Exchange Commission must act quickly when transactions involve possible insider trading by foreigners because once the money leaves the United States it will never come back. In suing two Spaniards over trading in call options of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc., the S.E.C. filed its case only three days after the sales that generated profits of more than $1 million because one of the defendants sought to transfer the money in his account back to Spain. About White Collar Watch Peter J. Henning, writing for DealBook’s White Collar Watch, is a commentator on white-collar crime and litigation. A former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement division and then a prosecutor at the Justice Department, he is a professor at the Wayne State University Law School. He is currently working on a book, “The Prosecution and Defense of Public Corruption: The Law and Legal Strategies,” to be published by Oxford University Press. The S.E.C. has brought numerous insider trading cases involving overseas securities transactions, and the defendants usually do not show up in the United States for fear of possible criminal prosecution. But one of the Spanish defendants, Luis Martin Caro Sanchez, appeared at a hearing on Thursday in the United States District Court in Chicago, where the case is being pursued, which may put him at risk of being charged by the Justice Department and, at a minimum, subjects him to the S.E.C.’s civil discovery. The S.E.C. filed an insider trading complaint on Aug. 20 that names Mr. Caro Sanchez and Juan Jose Fernández Garcia for trading in out-of-the-money call options of Potash in the days before BHP Billiton announced its nearly $39 billion offer for the company. Mr. Fernández Garcia bought a number of options that were set to expire in less than a week – a highly speculative trade given the price range of Potash Corporation ’s stock before the announcement of the offer. The S.E.C. also determined that Mr. Fernández Garcia works for Banco Santander as the head of its European equity derivatives research office, and the bank was part of a consortium of lenders BHP will use to finance its offer. He did not work on the deal, however, nor is it clear whether he had contact with anyone else at Banco Santander working on the Potash transaction. Well-timed trades generating profits of more than $1 million on an investment of about $60,000 within only a few days, coupled with a defendant who works for an adviser on the deal, were enough to make the S.E.C. highly suspicious. But that does not establish securities fraud for insider trading, which requires proof of a breach of fiduciary duty by Mr. Fernández Garcia, if he was the source of the information. The case against Mr. Caro Sanchez is even more speculative at this point because it is not clear whether Mr. Caro Sanchez received any information about Potash from Mr. Fernández Garcia. Both live in the same area in Madrid, are about the same age, and used the same broker to buy the call options, but they live in a city of more than three million, so proximity alone does not prove a connection. Their trading patterns were similar, but not identical. Mr. Fernández Garcia bought a range of Potash call options with different expiration dates and strike prices, while Mr. Caro Sanchez purchased only September calls with a $125 strike price. Certainly suspicious, but again not proof that there is a link between them, much less that Mr. Fernández Garcia passed inside information to Mr. Caro Sanchez. Normally, the S.E.C. would not file a case based only on suspicious trading and a potential link to nonpublic information, but it had to act quickly when the profits were on the verge of leaving the country. So while the S.E.C. claims in its filings that there is “strong circumstantial evidence” of insider trading by Mr. Fernández Garcia and Mr. Caro Sanchez, in fact its case is still at the preliminary stage in which it has a lot of suspicious trading but little hard evidence to prove securities fraud. Although the S.E.C. may not be able to prove insider trading now, its evidence was certainly enough to get a federal court to issue an asset freeze while the enforcement division continues its investigation to gather the evidence needed to prove its case. The threshold for a temporary restraining order sought by a government agency is fairly low, so the S.E.C. is usually successful in at least keeping the money in the United States while it tries to ferret out information to make its case. A freeze order puts the onus on the foreign defendant to appear in the United States if the person wants to assert a claim to the funds. Once the person submits to the jurisdiction of the federal court, then the S.E.C. can obtain discovery, including the person’s deposition and documents. Most foreign defendants choose not to fight the case by appearing in court, and the S.E.C. usually can gather enough evidence to obtain a default judgment. Such a judgment at least allows for the frozen funds to be turned over to investors who were victimized by the insider trading – in this case, the options market makers on the losing end of the propitious transactions. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Caro Sanchez appeared at a hearing on the case without a lawyer and that the proceedings had to be translated because of his limited understanding of English. It may well be that he did not understand the implications of showing up at the hearing, because he has submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the federal court and now will have to comply with its orders. It is not clear whether he has the means to retain a lawyer, and an S.E.C. action is civil so there is no constitutional right to appointed counsel, unlike a criminal prosecution. Although he would be well-advised to retain a lawyer, the damage may have already been done. By coming to the United States, Mr. Caro Sanchez may also be a target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. His Potash options transactions bear the hallmarks of rather blatant insider trading. If Mr. Caro Sanchez does not leave the United States fairly soon, it may indicate that a criminal investigation has started and his freedom to return home to Spain has been limited. – Peter J.

		<content>Small Businesses Struggle, Impeding a Recovery - NYTimes.com from the Federal Reserve suggest that the credit market for small businesses is healing. Rising housing values, too, are good for small-business borrowers, who often take out personal loans to finance their businesses. “The banks are not lending. They claim they are, but they’re not,” said Summit Kumar, president of Summit Telecom, a telecommunications company in Hicksville, N.Y. “I got a line of credit from a bank five years ago and I paid it back. Now the same bank says I’m ‘high-risk business’ and turns me away.” He acknowledges that his business has taken a hit in recent years and that he has had to lay off employees, but he says that his inability to get credit is part of the problem. He says he has had to resort to cash advance companies that expect him to pay back loans at exorbitant interest rates. One alternative lender said it would give him $50,000 if he paid it back with $75,000 six months later. The struggles of small businesses ripple through the rest of the economy. They are reluctant to invest in expensive capital equipment, for one. Mr. Starkey said that eight or nine years ago he could have justified investing in a $25,000 piece of equipment that would help him make a particular piece for a Ford Mustang, since he knew he would be able to earn back his investment in six months. But today, he doesn’t know if he will be able to get a return in six months or two years, and “having that kind of money tied up in one item is just too great a risk.” Metrics of small-business hiring and hiring intentions are also very low, according to the National Federation of Independent Business and the Labor Department. That might partly explain why so many middle-age women have dropped out of the labor force in recent years, said Mr. Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisers, since women are more likely to be employed at smaller service sector companies than, say, manufacturers. “Until the small-business sector starts to feel better,” he said, “the rest of the economy isn’t going to feel much better either.”</content>

		<content>What to Tell Children About Their Bequest and When - NYTimes.com What she wished was that her parents had talked to her more openly about how different their life was from everyone else’s — something that became apparent when she left Manhattan and landed at the University of Chicago. “My mom didn’t feel comfortable talking about money,” she said. That fell to her father, who was a public-school teacher. “He tried to teach me how to fit into the world.” What heirs should know and when is the question every parent wants answered, Mr. Williams said. “The biblical story about the prodigal son was really about a son who wasn’t prepared,” he said. “It’s the same problem today.” The better question parents should ask themselves, he said, is what they want to accomplish with the money. Waiting may result in a higher tax bill but could avoid generations of family discord. , said he sometimes suggested that parents give their children a small amount of money at an early age and see what happens. Beyond that, though, his best advice is to take their time. “People often talk about the values around money, that they want their kids to think about other people and they want them to be entrepreneurial,” Mr. Ladouceur said. “That’s a lot of talk. The more I talk, the more my kids zone me out. But if I exemplify the action, they seem to get it quicker.” , a group of socially minded young inheritors, said her parents had always been generous in helping out friends in need and being involved in their community. But her family had never talked about how much money was in the trust funds she and her cousins would receive. “For lots of us, we’ve not been given the tools to talk about money because it’s not polite,” she said. Yet she had the advantage of coming from a family that had been wealthy for generations and was able to advise her. This is where taking time to figure things out matters. Doug Ideker, 58, has spent the last nine years, since he sold his building supply company, Gypsum Products, working with his wife, Terrie, and their two sons to make sure their money is put to good use. “I felt a greater responsibility to make sure my kids knew what the expectations were and to make those expectations realistic,” he said. Mr. Ideker said he was fortunate that his sons, 29 and 33, had seen him go to work every day and knew the sacrifices he had made in building his business. “But all of a sudden that stopped and there was this pool of money sitting there and they saw me throttle back,” he said. “It would have been easy for them to think, ‘Hey, this is pretty good.’ To their credit, I don’t think they ever thought that way.” He added, “Terrie and I were very open and honest with them: they needed to be responsible citizens, they needed to create jobs, and they also knew that we had expectations that they would give back.”</content>

		<content>Bobby Kotick of Activision, Drawing Praise and Wrath - NYTimes.com This past July, Activision was the talk of Allen and Company’s media and technology retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho, after reports emerged that Vivendi had consulted Goldman Sachs and Barclays in Activision Blizzard. At a price tag of roughly $8.1 billion, no buyer immediately emerged. The uncertainty has put pressure on Activision’s stock, which closed at $11.41 on Friday, down from a 52-week high of $13.01 in May. A spokesman for Vivendi declined to comment. As the stakes in the video game industry have skyrocketed, so have the number of lawsuits. Gaming has started to look more like the movie industry, with creators and executives often suing each other over who should benefit from the windfall of profits on successful games. against two of the founders of Infinity Ward, the video game developer and Activision subsidiary that created Call of Duty. Activision acquired for $5 million in 2003; since then, it has turned Call of Duty into a multibillion-dollar franchise and one of the world’s most lucrative entertainment assets. The developers Jason West and Vince Zampella sued Activision, accusing it of wrongful termination, after they were fired in 2010. Activision countersued, contending that the employees had been disloyal. Activision later sued Electronic Arts for recruiting Mr. West and Mr. Zampella. The lawsuit enraged the game world. Mr. Kotick was painted as an evil capitalist and the developers as creative heroes. But Mr. Kotick says the decision to let the developers go was a no-brainer. “You find out two executives are planning to break their contracts, keep the money you gave them and steal 40 employees. What do you do? You fire them,” he says. Robert M. Schwartz, a lawyer for Mr. West and Mr. Zampella, said Mr. Kotick had “falsely promised huge bonuses and franchise control” to his clients. Jeff Brown, a spokesman for Electronic Arts, said Mr. Kotick’s “history of suing developers and competitors” appears to be “a fundamental part of his business model.” CALL OF DUTY may look like a movie, but Mr. Kotick has little interest in turning it into one — and has turned down several studios’ requests. He says movies based on video games rarely please devoted fans and could taint the brand. “He’s a very, very careful thinker about how value is created in the business,” says Bruce Hack, who was chief executive of Vivendi Games when it merged with Activision. He says that most Silicon Valley companies, meanwhile, haven’t figured out how to make money on free online games. , which makes up an estimated one-third of Activision’s more than $4 billion in annual revenue, faces a potential threat from the Electronic Arts shooter game In 2010, Activision stopped making Guitar Hero, the game that lets users become living-room rock stars, after the market became flooded with it and related knockoffs. Since then, Activision has lacked a game that widely appeals to women. “Guitar Hero was much more about us not innovating in a way that was appealing to audiences,” Mr. Kotick says. “It’s not about oversaturating the market.” Last year, Activision released the first version of Skylanders, a video game with accompanying figurines; it’s aimed at young boys. Mr. Kotick, giddy about an entirely new concept in a company based mostly on old reliables, showed off a stack of prototype Skylanders action figures to friends. “We’re at some fancy-pantsy restaurant, and he has a shopping bag with him,” Mr. Katzenberg recalls. “I’m trying to be polite, but everyone is staring at us like we’ve lost our minds. Here are two grown men playing with toys.” Mr. Katzenberg, a prominent donor in Democratic Party politics, says he’s close to Mr. Kotick despite their political differences. Mr. Kotick, who calls himself a libertarian, voted for Mitt Romney for president, and in 2007 and 2008 donated a combined $47,000 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr. Kotick’s restlessness and competitiveness lead his friends to speculate about what he will do next, and whether it will be at Activision or elsewhere. “I like what I’m doing,” Mr. Kotick says. “If I didn’t like what I was doing, I’d be doing something else.” “He’s got to decide what to do with the rest of his life,” says Mr. Wynn from somewhere over the Atlantic. He compares Mr. Kotick to the millionaire bank robber who tested his luck with a second heist in “The Thomas Crown Affair” — the 1968 version with Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen. “I think all of us in life want to know if we can do it twice.”</content>

		<content>Google Casts a Big Shadow on Smaller Web Sites - NYTimes.com STARTING in February, Jeffrey G. Katz grew increasingly anxious as he watched the steady decline of online traffic to his company’s In a geeky fire drill, engineers and outside consultants at Nextag scrambled to see if the problem was its own fault. Maybe some inadvertent change had prompted Google’s algorithm to demote Nextag when a person typed in shopping-related search terms like “kitchen table” or “lawn mower.” But no, the engineers determined. And traffic from Google’s search engine continued to decline, by half. Nextag’s response? It doubled its spending on Google paid search advertising in the last five months. The move was costly but necessary to retain shoppers, Mr. Katz says, because an estimated 60 percent of Nextag’s traffic comes from Google, both from free search and paid search ads, which are ads that are related to search results and appear next to them. “We had to do it,” says Mr. Katz, chief executive of Regulators in the United States and Europe are conducting sweeping inquiries of Google, the dominant Internet search and advertising company. Google rose by technological innovation and business acumen; in the United States, it has 67 percent of the search market and collects 75 percent of search ad dollars. Being big is no crime, but if a powerful company uses market muscle to stifle competition, that is an antitrust violation. So the government is focusing on life in Google’s world for the sprawling economic ecosystem of Web sites that depend on their ranking in search results. What is it like to live this way, in a giant’s shadow? The experience of its inhabitants is nuanced and complex, a blend of admiration and fear. The relationship between Google and Web sites, publishers and advertisers often seems lopsided, if not unfair. Yet Google has also provided and nurtured a landscape of opportunity. Its ecosystem generates $80 billion a year in revenue for 1.8 million businesses, Web sites and nonprofit organizations in the United States alone, it estimates. The government’s scrutiny of Google is the most exhaustive investigation of a major corporation since the pursuit of Microsoft in the late 1990s. The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has recommended preparing an antitrust suit against Google, according to people briefed on the inquiry, who spoke on the condition they not be identified. But the commissioners must vote to proceed. Even if they do, the government and Google could settle. Google has drawn the attention of antitrust officials as it has moved aggressively beyond its dominant product — search and search advertising — into fields like online commerce and local reviews. The antitrust issue is whether Google uses its search engine to favor its offerings like “What to do with an attractive monopolist, like Google, is a really challenging issue for antitrust,” says and a former senior adviser to the F.T.C. “The goal is to encourage them to stay in power by continuing to innovate instead of excluding competitors.” SPEAKING at a Google Zeitgeist conference in Arizona last month, Larry Page, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, the government scrutiny of his company, given Google’s size and reach. “There’s very many decisions we make that really impact a lot of people,” he acknowledged. The main reason is that Google is continually adjusting its search algorithm — the smart software that determines the relevance, ranking and presentation of search results, typically links to other Web sites. Google says it makes the changes to improve its service, and has long maintained that its algorithm weeds out low-quality sites and shows the most useful results, whether or not they link to Google products. “Our first and highest goal has to be to get the user the information they want as quickly and easily as possible,” says Matt Cutts, leader of the Web spam team at Google. , a nonprofit group started in 2003. It provides online information for voters to avoid the frustration of arriving at a polling booth and barely recognizing half the names on the ballot. The site posts free sample ballots for federal, state and local elections with candidates’ pictures, biographies and views on issues. In the 2004 and 2006 elections, users created tens of thousands of sample ballots. By 2008, traffic had fallen sharply, says Ron Kahlow, who runs As founder of a search-engine optimization company and a recipient of grants that Google gives nonprofits to advertise free, Mr. Kahlow knows a thing or two about how to operate in Google’s world.

		<content>Acxiom, the Quiet Giant of Consumer Database Marketing - NYTimes.com It peers deeper into American life than the F.B.I. or the I.R.S., or those prying digital eyes at Facebook and Google. If you are an American adult, the odds are that it knows things like your age, race, sex, weight, height, marital status, education level, politics, buying habits, household health worries, vacation dreams — and on and on. Right now in Conway, Ark., north of Little Rock, more than 23,000 computer servers are collecting, collating and analyzing consumer data for a company that, unlike Silicon Valley’s marquee names, rarely makes headlines. It’s called the Few consumers have ever heard of Acxiom. But analysts say it has amassed the world’s largest commercial database on consumers — and that it wants to know much, much more. Its servers process more than 50 trillion data “transactions” a year. Company executives have said its database contains information about 500 million active consumers worldwide, with about 1,500 data points per person. That includes a majority of adults in the United States. Such large-scale data mining and analytics — based on information available in public records, consumer surveys and the like — are perfectly legal. Acxiom’s customers have included big banks like Wells Fargo and HSBC, investment services like E*Trade, automakers like Toyota and Ford, department stores like Macy’s — just about any major company looking for insight into its customers. For Acxiom, based in Little Rock, the setup is lucrative. It posted profit of $77.26 million in its latest fiscal year, on sales of $1.13 billion. But such profits carry a cost for consumers. Federal authorities say current laws may not be equipped to handle the rapid expansion of an industry whose players often collect and sell sensitive financial and health information yet are nearly invisible to the public. In essence, it’s as if the ore of our data-driven lives were being mined, refined and sold to the highest bidder, usually without our knowledge — by companies that most people rarely even know exist. , says she would like data brokers in general to tell the public about the data they collect, how they collect it, whom they share it with and how it is used. “If someone is listed as diabetic or pregnant, what is happening with this information? Where is the information going?” she asks. “We need to figure out what the rules should be as a society.” Although Acxiom employs a chief privacy officer, Jennifer Barrett Glasgow, she and other executives declined requests to be interviewed for this article, said Ines Rodriguez Gutzmer, director of corporate communications. In March,  however, Ms. Barrett Glasgow  endorsed increased industry openness. “It’s not an unreasonable request to have more transparency among data brokers,” she said in an interview with The New York Times.  In marketing materials, Acxiom promotes itself as But, in interviews, security experts and consumer advocates paint a portrait of a company with practices that privilege corporate clients’ interests over those of consumers and contradict the company’s stance on transparency. Acxiom’s marketing materials, for example, promote a special security system for clients and associates to encrypt the data they send. Yet cybersecurity experts who examined Acxiom’s Web site for The Times found basic security lapses on an online form for consumers seeking access to their own profiles. (Acxiom says it has fixed the broken link that caused the problem.) In a fast-changing digital economy, Acxiom is developing even more advanced techniques to mine and refine data. It has recruited talent from Microsoft, Google, Amazon.com and Myspace and is using a powerful, multiplatform approach to predicting consumer behavior that could raise its standing among investors and clients. Of course, digital marketers already customize pitches to users, based on their past activities. Just think of “cookies,” bits of computer code placed on browsers to keep track of online activity. But Acxiom, analysts say, is pursuing far more comprehensive techniques in an effort to influence consumer decisions. It is integrating what it knows about our offline, online and even mobile selves, creating in-depth behavior portraits in pixilated detail. Its executives have called this approach a “360-degree view” on consumers. . “But Acxiom’s advantage is they have a database of offline information that they have been collecting for 40 years and can leverage that expertise in the digital world.” Yet some prominent privacy advocates worry that such techniques could lead to a new era of consumer profiling. SCOTT HUGHES, an up-and-coming small-business owner and Facebook denizen, is Acxiom’s ideal consumer. Indeed, it created him.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com Many Alarms Rang Before MF Global Crashed  |  While the commodities and derivatives broker MF Global fell apart with ferocious speed, the collapse came after regulators raised warning flags for more than four months. They told MF Global it needed to raise more capital, and they asked about risky transactions involving European debt. Yet its chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, resisted, lobbying to persuade regulators that the firm did not need to raise capital, according to people briefed on the discussions. MF Global did improve its capital position, but it was not enough to save the firm. The details that have emerged about MF Global’s final 72 hours, drawn from dozens of interviews with people who participated in the weekend discussions or were directly briefed by people who did, illustrate that three years after the financial crisis, Wall Street executives are still fighting regulators’ demands.

		<content>UK Mortgage Approvals Rise More Than Expected in March - NYTimes.com LONDON (Reuters) - British mortgage approvals for house purchase bounced back more strongly than expected in March, in a further sign homebuyers are benefiting from the central bank's flagship credit scheme. Lending to businesses fell last month, but at a slower pace than in February, Bank of England data showed on Tuesday. The central bank has been hoping that its Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), opened in August and revamped last week, will boost the flow of credit to households and businesses, thus easing what it sees as a major drag on the economy. Mortgage approvals numbered 53,504 in March, up from 51,947 in February and a thousand more than analysts had forecast. Before the 2008 financial crisis, monthly mortgage approvals ran at around 90,000, but the number of home sales has slumped since then and is only slowly starting to recover. Lending to non-financial businesses shrank for a second straight month, by a net 0.6 billion pounds. Within that, lending to smaller firms dropped by 0.1 billion pounds, erasing the previous month's gain. Last week the central bank and the finance ministry retooled the FLS, giving banks greater incentives to lend to small and medium-sized firms which complain they are starved of credit. The BoE's preferred gauge of money supply, M4 excluding intermediate other financial corporations, rose 0.3 percent, taking the annual growth rate to 4.5 percent.</content>

		<content>Conn. Casino in Running for AAC Conference Tourney - NYTimes.com HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — A tribal casino in Connecticut is bidding to host the men's and women's basketball tournaments for the new American Athletic Conference. Chris Sienko, vice president for the Mohegan Sun, which includes a 9,500-seat arena that is home to the WNBA's Connecticut Sun, said the resort is interested in hosting one or both tournaments. "We have no insight as to whether we'll be chosen or be a finalist," said Sienko, who also serves as general manager for the WNBA team. "We're just going through the same process that everyone else is going through to be vetted out by the AAC." Conference officials confirm the venue is in the running, but said the sites for each tournament will be chosen separately by the presidents and athletic directors of the member schools, with input from coaches. The topic will be discussed at the upcoming conference meetings, which begin May 20. The conference is also considering cities such as Louisville, Cincinnati, Memphis and Hartford to host the men's tournament. It is also looking at venues for the women's tournament in places such as central Florida. Hartford's XL Center, where the Big East has held its tournament since 2004, also remains in the mix, officials said. "Due to the powerful fan base in Connecticut and the past success of our championship over the past 10 years in Connecticut, consideration of multiple venues in that state makes sense as we work to consider a group of venues across our footprint and secure our future direction," said Danielle Donehew, the Big East's associate commissioner for women's basketball who will continue with the AAC. The decision comes at the same time the XL Center is changing management. Chris Lawrence, the building's new general manager, said they are also hopeful they can bring one or both tournaments to Hartford. "It's something new for them and an opportunity for them to get out and see what else is out there, but we're going to go out and put our foot forward and see how things shake out," he said. "That track record of proven success here, I think speaks for itself. It's kind of up to us to make sure we're engaged with the league and in constant communication with them." The casino, which is owned by the Mohegan tribe, has made pitches in the past to host the Big East women's tournament. But the idea was rejected by presidents of several Catholic schools, who objected to playing at a gambling venue. Those schools have split off to form their own conference, which is keeping the Big East name. Sienko said they are hopeful the current AAC institutions, which will include UConn, will be more receptive. "With so many tournaments now being played in Las Vegas, we think that a lot of conferences are now understanding that you need to go someplace where it's more viable for your conference to showcase itself and what it has to offer," Sienko said. The Pac-12 this year held its men's tournament at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, one of four conference tournaments held in that city. Atlantic City, N.J., has also hosted the Atlantic 10 tournament in Boardwalk Hall, which sits among a strip of casinos. The Sun currently hosts the annual Hall of Fame Tip Off tournament, has hosted other NCAA games and serves as the site for the state high school basketball championships. Sienko said his resort offers the conference amenities few other venues can match, including a hotel and box office on site, 30 restaurants, retail shops and 13,000 free parking spaces. UConn's athletic director, Warde Manuel, said he doesn't see gambling as an issue, especially because the Mohegan Sun does not have a sports book. "I think we're past the idea that having a tournament in an arena attached to a casino, that in some type of way we're influencing people to gamble," he said. "I don't see that tie." UConn women's coach Geno Auriemma said it makes sense to put the tournaments in Connecticut, where UConn with its eight NCAA women's titles and three men's titles is the conference's biggest name. "Given the fact that the league is so new and we are kind of geographically challenged, so to speak, in terms of finding someplace in the middle, I would hope that this is viewed the same way Madison Square Garden was viewed by the Big East," he said.</content>

		<content>Analysis - Nigeria Faces Long, Bumpy Road to Making the Lights Work - NYTimes.com ABUJA (Reuters) - In an unwanted daily routine lasting 17 years, Phillip Cleatus sits in the dark doorway of his shoe-making shop in Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna, waiting for the lights to come back on. President Goodluck Jonathan is trying to persuade Cleatus and some 170 million other Nigerians that will soon change. Yet while his plan to privatize power is creeping forward, it is likely to take decades to end the chronic electricity shortages that are among the main barriers to investment and growth in Africa's second biggest economy and top oil producer. Nigeria is in the process of breaking up the defunct state power company into 17 private generation and distribution companies and selling them for about $2.5 billion in total, as part of efforts to increase electricity output tenfold over the next seven years. It might be its most advanced effort yet to end its perennial power shortfall, but progress has been so slow that Jonathan's targets look far too optimistic. Industry experts believe some improvements will be felt in 2-3 years. If Nigeria gets the lights working it would reduce business costs by up to 40 percent, add 3 percent to GDP and cut the mass unemployment that fuels unrest seen in oil theft in the south and a bloody Islamist insurgency in the north, economists say. It could also spur a boom in labor intensive areas like manufacturing, food processing, textiles and pharmaceuticals, while opening up the opportunity for new low-cost service industries like the call centers that aided India's rise. The $13 billion a year that Nigerians spend on diesel, most of which is imported, would be a bill of the past. Power from generators costs more than twice as much as from the grid. "This is killing my business, I lose 45 percent of my annual profit to poor power supply," Cleatus, 38, told Reuters. A glitzy ceremony hosted by Jonathan last week celebrated the first payment by private companies which are taking over the unbundled state electricity firm and a deal by the World Bank to give an initial $145 million risk guarantee for gas supply. A close look at the private companies which won bids shows a mix of oligarchs and influential figures connected to Nigeria's political elite, and some recognized technical partners like Siemens and Manila Electric. This has raised some questions about the expected efficiency of the privatization process and what it can deliver, but there are those who argue that effective business in Nigeria is impossible without political connections and patrons. "Much has been achieved, yet the race will not be over until Nigerians can take electricity supply for granted," Jonathan told dignitaries and power companies last week at his villa. Electricity capacity had been in steady decline for a decade when Jonathan launched his reform plan in 2010, pledging Nigeria would boost generation from 3,000 megawatts (MW) to 10,000 MW by the end of this year, and 40,000 MW by 2020. Generation has increased to around 4,000 MW but experts say there is zero hope of meeting government targets, while the scale of the task means power output will initially fall after the privatization is completed at the end of this year. Despite being Africa's top oil producer and holding the world's ninth largest gas reserves, Nigeria's power output is a tenth of South Africa's for a population three times the size. "It will probably take Nigeria another 50 years before it attains the same level of electricity consumption per capita as South Africa currently enjoys today," said David Ladipo, whose company Azura is spending $700 million to build a 450 MW plant. Ladipo thinks electricity output could grow to 6,000 MW in the next two years and to 9,000 MW by 2020, before seeing a potential boom as post-privatization investment kicks in. One industry expert told Reuters Nigeria's potential demand is estimated to be as high as 140,000 MW and rising, so just keeping up with demand will be a huge challenge. Even Ladipo's more modest projections, which several other industry experts broadly agreed with, face hurdles. Privatization is months behind schedule and government is struggling to get the funding it needs for crucial transmission and gas supply infrastructure. Powerful labor unions are blocking attempts to pay off 40,000 state electricity workers. Nigeria says it has found 340 billion naira ($2.1 billion) to pay off the workers, but they remain reluctant to leave. The African Development Bank is providing $150 million to aid with transmission and some of a $1 billion debut Eurobond would help with upgrades. But in Nigeria, just making the money available doesn't always mean it will be used wisely. Some $40 billion has gone into several power reform drives in the last 20 years, industry experts say, much of it wasted. "In the past the problem has not been capacity of government to find money for the power sector: billions have been allocated - and billions have been squandered or stolen," said Antony Goldman, head of Africa-focused PM Consulting. Still, there remains optimism that wrestling power out of government hands will eventually lead to progress. "Given the scale of the challenge and the history of the sector ... reform is progressing very well," said Fola Fabule, a Lagos-based investment banker focused on infrastructure finance.</content>

The conference was sponsored by Google, whose YouTube division is a reason the video-content business is offering marketers opportunities amid the struggle of adapting to the most significant shift in media habits since, well, the dawn of television. “It’s a head-spinning time to be in video,” said one speaker, Justin Evans, senior vice president for emerging media at Collective, an online advertising network. “I guess that’s what it feels like when you’re at the beginning of the future.” “It is early days,” said Mr. Proulx, senior vice president and director for digital strategy at Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, whose new book, “Social TV,” explores how social media like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter seem to encourage consumers to watch television shows live so they can share comments and content. “We’re experiencing television in such different ways,” Mr. Proulx said, that Madison Avenue ought to “look at TV as, believe it or not, a new medium, and get rid of the word ‘traditional.’ ” on CBS — may help explain a survey released at the conference by the advertiser association and Forrester Research. The number of respondents who said they believed television advertising had become more effective has tripled since the last survey, taken in 2010. Although “it’s been pretty fashionable for different pundits to bash television,” said Bill Duggan, group executive vice president at the advertiser association, watching video content and interacting with it on various screens is booming. He acknowledged that “the more screens there are, the more challenges there are to measure who’s viewing,” but cited initiatives like Making Measurement Make Sense, by the advertiser association, the Four A’s (formerly the American Association of Advertising Agencies) and the Interactive Advertising Bureau, to develop standard metrics. One speaker, Ralph Santana, represented a company that makes screens and uses them for advertising. “Second screens are changing the viewer experience,” said Mr. Santana, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Samsung Electronics North America, who cited statistics from Nielsen that 68 percent of smartphone owners, and 70 percent of tablet owners, said they used those devices while watching television. “We’ve got to continue to be brave and do a lot of experimentation,” he said. “We need to start rethinking content and how we tell stories as marketers.” Mr. Santana advocated “story-sharing, fueled by social media,” as a successor to brand story-telling, and gave as an example a campaign, the U.S. Olympic Genome Project, that will support the Samsung sponsorship of the 2012 Summer Olympics. The campaign, created by the Team Epic unit of the Aegis Group, will enable Facebook members to learn “how closely they are connected” to members of the United States Olympic team, Mr. Santana said. Another speaker, Chris Robison, senior director for product management and advertising solutions at Adobe Systems, urged Madison Avenue to recognize that “consumers are adopting digital video faster than we are.” “Our challenge is to make advertising more relevant and impactful,” he added, “through video, social and mobile.” “I’m carrying six different devices with me right now,” he told the audience. In an interview later, he identified them as two smartphones, Another reminder of the relative aspects of the second screen was provided by an executive who attended the conference, David F. Poltrack, chief research officer at the CBS Corporation. “Before you can have a second-screen experience in this new, two-screen world, you have to have a first-screen experience,” Mr. Poltrack said, smiling, which is where CBS can “deliver for marketers.” In a conference call Wednesday on CBS’s earnings, Mr. Poltrack’s boss, Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, discussed the on CBS, which broke recent ratings records, and how the Grammys Live iPad app offered by CBS Interactive “reached No. 1 on the iTunes chart.” Tom Cunniff, vice president and director for interactive communications at Combe Inc., asked the members of a panel he moderated whether the second-screen experience may “risk splintering people’s attention.” Nadine McHugh, vice president for global media at Colgate-Palmolive, replied, “Consumers are already fragmenting their attention,” adding that if a video promises “a good story, a story worth sharing, it’ll capture their attention.” She said she preferred the term “sociable TV” to “social TV,” urging marketers to start “creating an experience consumers want to engage with over a longer period of time.” An example was given by another speaker, Bob Kraut, senior vice president for advertising and marketing communications at the Arby’s Restaurant Group, who described a that invited consumers to create online video based on the Arby’s ad campaign after he noticed clips on YouTube in which consumers performed versions of the campaign jingle. “Maybe we were estimating 300” entries, Mr. Kraut said. “There were 1,400.” The winner, Andy Johnson, an Iowa schoolteacher, received $10,000 and appeared in a commercial created by the Arby’s ad agency, BBDO New York.</content>

		<content>Pauline Phillips, Flinty Adviser to Millions as Dear Abby, Dies at 94 - NYTimes.com Dear Abby: My wife sleeps in the raw. Then she showers, brushes her teeth and fixes our breakfast — still in the buff. We’re newlyweds and there are just the two of us, so I suppose there’s really nothing wrong with it. What do you think? — Ed Pauline Phillips, a California housewife who nearly 60 years ago, seeking something more meaningful than mah-jongg, transformed herself into the syndicated columnist Dear Abby — and in so doing became a trusted, tart-tongued adviser to tens of millions — died on Wednesday Her syndicate, Universal Uclick, announced her death on its Web site. Mrs. Phillips, who had been ill with Alzheimer’s disease for more than a decade, was a longtime resident of Beverly Hills, Calif., but lived in Minneapolis in recent years to be near family. If Damon Runyon and Groucho Marx had gone jointly into the advice business, their column would have read much like Dear Abby’s. With her comic and flinty yet fundamentally sympathetic voice, Mrs. Phillips helped wrestle the advice column from its weepy Victorian past into a hard-nosed 20th-century present: Dear Abby: I have always wanted to have my family history traced, but I can’t afford to spend a lot of money to do it. Have you any suggestions? — M. J. B. in Oakland, Calif. Mrs. Phillips began her life as the columnist Abigail Van Buren in 1956. She quickly became known for her astringent, often genteelly risqué, replies to queries that included the marital, the medical and sometimes both at once: She was also known for her long, much-publicized professional rivalry with her identical twin sister, the advice columnist Ann Landers. Long before the Internet — and long before the pervasive electronic confessionals of Dr. Ruth, Dr. Phil, Dr. Laura, et al. — the Dear Abby column was a forum for the public discussion of private problems, read by tens of millions of people in hundreds of newspapers around the world. It is difficult to overstate the column’s influence on American culture at midcentury and afterward: in popular parlance, Dear Abby was for decades an affectionate synonym for a trusted, if slightly campy, confidante. On television, the column has been invoked on shows as diverse as “Three’s Company,” “Dexter” and “Mr. Ed,” where, in a 1964 episode in which Mrs. Phillips played herself, the title character, pining (in an equine way, of course) for a swinging bachelor pad of his own, writes her a letter. Even now, Dear Abby’s reach is vast. (Mrs. Phillips’s daughter, Jeanne Phillips, took over the column unofficially in 1987 and officially in 2000.) According to Universal Uclick, Dear Abby appears in about 1,400 newspapers worldwide, has a daily readership of more than 110 million — in print and on its Web site, Politically left of center, Mrs. Phillips was generally conservative when it came to personal deportment. As late as the 1990s, she was reluctant to advise unmarried couples to live together. Yet beneath her crackling one-liners lay an imperturbable acceptance of the vagaries of modern life: Dear Abby: Our son married a girl when he was in the service. They were married in February and she had an 8 1/2-pound baby girl in August. She said the baby was premature. Can an 8 1/2-pound baby be this premature? — Wanting to Know Mrs. Phillips was also keen, genteelly, to keep pace with the times. In 1976, she confided to People magazine that she had recently seen an X-rated movie. Her sister, she learned afterward, had wanted to see it, too, but feared being recognized. The youngest of four sisters, Pauline Esther Friedman, familiarly known as Popo, was born in Sioux City, Iowa, on July 4, 1918. Her twin, Esther Pauline (known as Eppie), beat her into the world by 17 minutes, just as she would narrowly beat her into the advice business. Their father, Abraham, was a Jewish immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who had made his start in the United States as an itinerant chicken peddler and, in an archetypal American success story, ended up owning a chain of movie theaters. The twins attended Morningside College in Sioux City, where they both studied journalism and psychology and wrote a joint gossip column for the school paper. As close as they were, the intense competitiveness that would later spill into the public arena was already apparent. “She wanted to be the first violin in the school orchestra, but I was,” Mrs. Phillips told Life magazine in 1958. “She swore she’d marry a millionaire, but I did.” In 1939, Pauline Friedman left college to marry Morton Phillips, an heir to a liquor fortune. She was married in a lavish double ceremony alongside Eppie, who, not to be outdone, was wed on the same day to Jules Lederer, a salesman who later founded the Budget Rent A Car corporation. As a young bride, Mrs. Phillips lived in Eau Claire, Wis., where her husband was an executive with the National Pressure Cooker Company, which his family had acquired. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misstated the day Mrs. Phillips died. It was Wednesday, not Thursday.</content>

		<content>Alaska Airlines, Flying Above an Industry’s Troubles - NYTimes.com in the wintertime is a spectacular experience. At 35,000 feet, the state’s rugged beauty unfolds, a succession of white mountain peaks against steel-blue skies, icy lakes and frozen rivers that snake as far as the eye can see. It’s an awesome sight, wild and pristine, that glows in a thousand hues of red, orange and pink when the sun sets against the horizon. Juneau’s airport is surrounded by mountains, the approach often buffeted by treacherous wind shear. Sitka’s one small runway is on a narrow strip of land surrounded by water. And in Kodiak, the landing strip ends abruptly at a mountainside. The airport approach is so tricky that first officers are not allowed to land there; only captains are trusted to do so. Doug Wahto knows these airports well. He grew up in Juneau, worked as a commercial fisherman and builder and started flying with Alaska Airlines in 1970. As a pilot, he honed the art of reading wind conditions by looking at how snow blew over mountain ridges. Mr. Wahto retired six years ago, but not before seeing the transformation of flying in Alaska and of the airline where he spent his career. Alaska Airlines is puny compared to the major carriers: it has 124 planes, while United Airlines has more than 700 and four times as many passengers. But because of the state’s topography and extreme weather, it was the first to develop satellite guidance, a navigation technique that has transformed landing at Alaska’s tricky airports. The technique is now at the heart of the Federal Aviation Administration’s plan to modernize the nation’s air traffic system, a project that is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars over the coming decades. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist,” Mr. Wahto says, “or a crusty old dog like me to fly these approaches anymore.” Largely because of that technology, flying in Alaska is now remarkably reliable — even in the dead of winter, when it is snowing, when there are just two hours of daylight, when runways are made slippery by ice or sleet, when winds blow at more than 50 miles an hour and pilots can barely see out the windshield. When, in other words, no one in his right mind would want to land a Boeing 737 with 140 passengers on a 6,000-foot runway. Alaska Airlines, in fact, had the industry’s best on-time performance for the third consecutive year in 2012, with 87 percent of flights landing on time, according to FlightStats, a data provider. That reliability means a lot in a state where air travel is often the only option, and where Alaska is the only commercial jet carrier with in-state routes. The airline flies to 16 towns accessible only by plane or boat, and, in doing so, ferries food and medical supplies, takes thousands of oil workers above the Arctic Circle and operates as the biggest air shipper for the state’s fisheries. This role as primary transport for in the state is still a healthy business, but Alaska Airlines has prospered by expanding its services. From its Seattle base, it now has a bigger presence than other airlines along much of the West Coast. In 2007, it moved into Hawaii; its flights to the state now account for 20 percent of its available seat miles, an industry standard for measuring capacity. That is more than the 17 percent in Alaska itself. , have redrawn the boundaries of domestic carriers, concentrating the business as never before. Alaska Airlines, for its part, has cultivated staunch independence. Unlike carriers that have faced bankruptcy or acquisition, Alaska has turned a profit for 33 of the last 39 years. In 2012, it had a record $316 million in net income, up 29 percent from 2011. Although it started in a sparsely populated, meteorologically unwelcoming, financially challenging corner of the country, Alaska has built a successful franchise that is the envy of many rivals.</content>

		<content>Lenders Flee Debt of European Nations and Banks - NYTimes.com Just as American policy makers assured the public then that the subprime problem could be contained, so European leaders thought until recently that the fiscal troubles of a small country like Greece would not spread. to $6.3 billion of European debt, other institutions have raced to purge their portfolios of similar investments. “This is just a repeat of what we saw in 2008, when everyone wanted to see toxic assets off the banks’ balance sheets,” said Christian Stracke, the head of credit research for Pimco. The European bond sell-off has been similarly sharp, accelerating in the third quarter, according to a research report by Goldman Sachs. European banks trimmed their exposure to Italy by more than 26 billion euros in the third quarter, for example. French banks like BNP Paribas and Société Générale, whose shares have been pounded lately because of their sovereign debt holdings, were among the biggest sellers. Meanwhile, American banks have become skittish about lending to European institutions over similar concerns. Of the biggest banks that lend to Europe, about two-thirds have pulled back on lending to their European counterparts, according to the most recent survey of loan officers by the Federal Reserve. American money market funds, long a key supplier of dollars to European banks through short-term loans, have also become nervous. Fund managers have cut their holdings of notes issued by euro zone banks by $261 billion from around its peak in May, a 54 percent drop, according to JPMorgan Chase research. With borrowing costs ticking higher, more institutions have started selling their sovereign debt, creating a frenzy that forces bond prices to plunge and yields to rise at dizzying speeds, which begets even more selling. In the case of Italy, the yield on 10-year bonds spiked to current levels in a month, a huge move by government bond market standards. The dynamic of falling bond prices also undermines the capital position of the banks, since they are among the biggest holders of government bonds in many countries. As those assets plunge in value, banks cut back on lending and hoard capital, increasing the likelihood of a In some cases, banks may even need to raise funds to shore up their financial positions. That was the case with UniCredit, Italy’s largest bank, which announced plans to raise 7.5 billion euros in capital earlier this week. “The biggest risk everyone is talking about is whether Italy can continue to fund itself,” said Pavan Wadhwa, an interest rate strategist at JPMorgan in London. He said Italy had auctions Nov. 25 and 29. Any sign that it is unable to sell its debt to investors would be troubling, he said. The prospect of slower growth across the Continent, and fears that budget deficits will balloon, is a major reason the selling has spread beyond Italian bonds to much stronger government borrowers with AAA credit ratings like France. “You have to interfere with these cycles at as many places as possible,” said Lawrence H. Summers, President Obama’s former chief economic adviser. “There is nothing good to be said about being tentative.” An article on Saturday about investors’ accelerating withdrawal from European sovereign debt misstated the title and experience of Peter R. Fisher, who commented on the trend’s detrimental effect on the fiscal health of Europe. He is the head of fixed income at the asset manager BlackRock, not a vice chairman, and he was a senior Treasury official in the administration of President George W. Bush, not of President Bill Clinton.</content>

		<content>How Gadgets, Chips, Services Companies Are Faring - NYTimes.com Companies providing gadgets, components, services and related software have begun releasing their earnings reports for the latest quarter. The reports come as consumers shift their spending toward phone and tablets and away from traditional PCs. Here's a look at how selected companies are faring. — April 5: Estimates from Samsung Electronics Co. show that operating profit for the first quarter grew 53 percent from a year earlier to 8.7 trillion won ($7.7 billion), outpacing expectations for what's normally a slow time for consumer electronics sales. Revenue grew 15 percent to 52 trillion won. Analysts say Samsung benefited from smartphone sales and shortages in memory chips for personal computers. — April 10: Research firms IDC and Gartner release reports showing unprecedented declines in sales of desktop and laptop machines during the first three months of the year. IDC says first-quarter shipments of PCs fell 14 percent worldwide from a year earlier. That's the deepest quarterly drop since the firm started tracking the industry in 1994. Another research firm, Gartner Inc., pegged the first-quarter decline at 11 percent. IDC Vice President Bob O'Donnell says Microsoft's release on Windows 8 in October "not only didn't provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market. — April 16: Intel Corp, the world's largest maker of chips for PCs, remains steadfast amid the drastic slowdown in computer sales. It says it's keeping its sales and margin forecasts for this year. The company is helped by rising shipments of chips for servers. Intel says it shipped 7 percent fewer PC chips compared with a year earlier, but 6 percent more server chips. Intel meets analyst forecasts for the just-ended quarter. — April 18: Microsoft Corp. says revenue and net income surged in the latest quarter, but much the gains were due to the recognition of sales that occurred before the launch of the latest versions of Windows and Office. Microsoft's Windows division reports a 23 percent increase in revenue to $5.7 billion, but adjusting for the deferred revenue, revenue was flat. IBM Corp. says first-quarter net income fell 1 percent due to delays in closing several large software and mainframe computer deals. IBM is seen as a good gauge of technology demand because it sells to major companies and governments around the world. That said, it's not immune from economic uncertainty and currency fluctuations, which showed in the quarter's results. IBM says weakness in the Japanese yen hurt the quarter's results. A weak yen translates to fewer dollars for IBM on sales in Japan. Nokia Corp.'s earnings report shows that it continues to take a hammering in the smartphone market, with revenue falling by 20 percent to 5.8 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in the first three months of the year. Mobile phone sales volumes fell across the globe — especially in China, which saw a 60 percent drop. The number of smartphones sold dropped 49 percent to 6.1 million units. Sales of other phones fell 21 percent to 55.8 million. — April 23: Apple Inc. says it will distribute $100 billion in cash to its shareholders by the end of 2015. At the same time, the company says revenue for the current quarter could fall from the year before, which would be the first decline in many years. Apple CEO Tim Cook also suggests that the company won't release any new products until the fall, contrary to expectations that there would be a new iPhone and iPads out this summer. Apple shipped 37.4 million iPhones in the latest quarter, up 7 percent from a year ago. It shipped 19.5 million iPads, up 65 percent. Mac sales were flat at about 4 million. — April 24: Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. reports quarterly earnings and forecast that fall in line with analyst estimates. But that disappoints investors spoiled by the company's recent run of success as the growing popularity of smartphones fueled the demand for its mobile microprocessors. Although smartphone sales are still climbing, Qualcomm is now facing fiercer competition from other chip makers, including Intel, which has been redesigning its microprocessors in an attempt to grab a bigger piece of the mobile computing market. Data storage equipment maker EMC Corp. reports a small decline in its first-quarter net income. The results fall short of Wall Street's expectations as the pace of its revenue growth continued to slow. CEO Joseph Tucci says EMC's customers remain cautious about technology spending because of the "continuing tide of political and economic uncertainties." — April 26: Samsung says its first-quarter profit jumped to a record high as smartphone sales remained strong despite the April launch of an updated version of its flagship Galaxy phone. Sales of consumer electronics usually slow down in the quarter after the holiday shopping season, an effect that analysts thought would be compounded by people waiting for the release of the Galaxy S4. Samsung says sales of the older Galaxy S III smartphone and the oversized handset called the Galaxy Note remained strong.</content>

		<content>Dow Ends Above 14,000 for Year’s Highest Close - NYTimes.com The Dow Jones industrial average rose to its highest close of the year Tuesday, putting it within 1 percent of its record. Stocks gained after two big consumer brands posted impressive quarterly results. The Dow closed up 47.46 points, or 0.34 percent, to 14,018.70 Tuesday. That is 146 points from its record close of 14,164.53 set in October 2007. The Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index gained 2.42 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,519.43, also close to its record. In a day of quiet trading, stocks were driven higher by the beauty products maker Avon and the luxury clothing and accessories company Michael Kors, whose results impressed investors. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity in the United States. Financial and home-building stocks, led by the Bank of America and the Masco Corporation, which reported some of the day’s biggest gains, also lifted the averages. The Dow has logged its best January in almost two decades after lawmakers reached a last-minute deal to avoid sweeping tax increases and spending cuts. Investors are also becoming more optimistic that the housing market is recovering and that hiring is picking up. The 30-member Dow has closed above 14,000 twice this month. Before February, the index closed above that level just nine times in its history. The first time was in July 2007; the rest were in October of that year. Shares of Avon rose $3.51, or 20 percent, to $20.79 after the company posted a fourth-quarter loss that was not as bad as analysts expected. The company also hopes to save $400 million by slashing costs. Michael Kors rose $5, or 9 percent, to $62 after reporting earnings that beat analysts’ predictions. Bank of America was the biggest gainer on the Dow, adding 38 cents, or 3.25 percent, to $12.24. Stocks gaining in the index outnumbered those falling by a ratio of more than four to one. About 70 percent of companies in the S.and P. 500 have reported earnings for the fourth quarter. Analysts are projecting that earnings will rise 6.4 percent for the period, an improvement from the 2.4 percent growth reported in the third quarter, according to S.and P. Capital IQ. Investors may have become too optimistic about the outlook for stocks, said Uri Landesman, president of the hedge fund Platinum Partners. “The market is priced for perfection,” Mr. Landesman said. “The odds of a disappointment are very, very high.” Mr. Landesman predicts that the S.and P. 500 will climb past its record and rise as high as 1,600 by April before then slumping as low as 1,300 as company earnings start to disappoint investors. The record close for the S.and P. 500 is 1,565, reached in October 2007. Investors were expected to be watching closely Tuesday night when President Obama delivered his annual A decline in bond prices since the beginning of the year has also slowed. The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 4/32 to 96 28/32 on Tuesday and the yield rose to 1.98 percent from 1.96 percent late Monday. The yield was 1.71 percent at the beginning of the year. In other trading Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite index was down 5.51 points, or 0.17 percent, to 3,186.49. Coca-Cola, the beverage company, fell $1.05, or 2.7 percent, to $37.56 after reporting fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts’ forecasts. Masco, a home improvement and building product company, rose $2.22, or nearly 13 percent, to $20.01 after reporting earnings that beat analysts’ expectations, helped by strong demand in North America. Dun and Bradstreet, a provider of credit and business data, fell $6.60, or 7.7 percent, to $78.68 after the company reported a fourth-quarter profit that was below market expectations.</content>

		<content>A Humbled Gap Tries a Fresh Coat of Pep - NYTimes.com And the paint looks fresh, the fixtures intact. Over here are pink and yellow jeans for women; over there, bright spring-fresh scarves. Upstairs is some cool-looking men’s denim. And, throughout, natural light chases away the usual drab florescence. a Gap — at the Grove, an upscale mall in Los Angeles. Only it’s more than a Gap — it’s a laboratory for reviving the brand, one of the great hot-to-not stories of American retailing. After defining 1990s khaki culture, Gap fell hard in the early 2000s. Management missteps, executive turnover and, not least, unappealing fashion punished sales. It was a remarkable comedown for a chain that once seemed to dictate how America dressed. , Glenn Murphy, has tried to satisfy Wall Street by cutting costs and closing stores. But sales last year were about where they were in 2002, despite big pushes overseas and online. (While What went wrong? Dozens of interviews with current and former executives depict a company that chased after rivals, rather than charting its own course, and that cut quality and lost touch with customers. Simply put, it filled its stores with stuff that people didn’t want. Which is why what’s happening at the Grove is so crucial. On a Tuesday in March, Art Peck, the president of Gap North America, surveyed the scene and liked what he saw. “If you drop someone in here and say, ‘What store are you in?,’ nobody would say the stereotypical Gap store,” Mr. Peck said. That, he implied, is a good thing. Mr. Peck wants to update Gap’s more than 1,000 North American stores. At the Grove, Gap is testing ways to build sales. The cheerier surroundings are a start. It’s also trying dressing rooms in the center of the store, and an on-site stylist. Other Gap stores are being spruced up, too, and, as Mr. Peck put it, Gap is “making sure our body forms all have the appropriate number of limbs attached to them.” The new clothes reflect Gap’s upbeat, “Be Bright” advertising campaign. And as those products hit the stores, Gap is getting a bit of good news. In February and March, same-store sales shot past analysts’ expectations. The share price of Gap Inc., the parent company, is clawing its way back, too. It had plummeted from $53 in February 2000, when Gap’s dot-com-era khaki was burying its rivals’ more formal business wear, to $9.50 in November 2008, at the height of the financial panic. On Friday, it closed at $28.53, up nearly 54 percent so far this year. “We really believe we have a diamond, and we just need it to be polished properly,” Mr. Murphy says. When Doris and Don Fisher founded the company in 1969 in San Francisco, they basically invented the specialty apparel store. Gap sold Levi’s in a bunch of sizes, aimed at the generation gap — hence the name. When Millard S. Drexler arrived as chief executive in the ’80s, Gap began selling its own clothes. Gap Inc. expanded Banana Republic, started Old Navy, and went on to dominate American clothing retailing for almost two decades. But by 2002, breakneck expansion caught up with it. The company was close to bankruptcy, and Paul Pressler, a Disney executive, was Yet by then, rivals like Zara and Juicy Couture were challenging Gap’s all-things-to-all-people approach. In 2007, Mr. Pressler stepped down and, according to someone familiar with the matter, a board representative reached out to Mr. Drexler, who by then was running J. Crew. Would he return if Gap bought Bill Chandler, a Gap spokesman, says that if this happened, it did not represent the board’s point of view. “It wasn’t like he came in and was like, ‘It’s all about beautiful product and the right marketing’ — there was none of that,” recalls Will Hunsinger, former general manager of Gap’s online unit. “It was, ‘We’ve got to learn how to work more efficiently.’ ” Mr. Murphy set about cutting costs, closing stores and pushing international growth. And on some fronts, the strategy showed results. Gap is growing fast in China and elsewhere, and Gap Inc. is still making money: profit was $1.1 billion in 2009, $1.2 billion in 2010, and $833 million in 2011, in the same range as in the middle of the last decade. But he largely left the fashion side of Gap alone. When clothes didn’t sell, he focused on market-share strategies rather than on trying to rethink what Gap was about. Some executives found this approach lacking. Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Gap Inc. bought Old Navy after Millard S. Drexler’s arrival as chief executive. Gap Inc. started Old Navy. An earlier version of this article also incorrectly stated that Glenn Murphy was the head of Shoppers Drug Mart when he was chosen as the chief of Gap’s board. He left that position before he was appointed.</content>

DealBook »   Government’s Role in British Bank Creates Uneasy Alliance  |  When Britain bailed out the Royal Bank of Scotland in 2008 and took a majority stake, the government promised to remain a passive investor. But some employees and analysts now say the line has blurred, as politicians push the bank to rein in executive compensation, bolster lending and limit risky businesses. While the bank says management makes its own decisions and politicians insist they do not dictate strategy, the government has recently taken a more hands-on role in the bank’s operations. During discussions about bonuses, British treasury officials talked to the bank’s executives several times a day. Each month, Stephen Hester, the chief executive, or other top executives meet with the government-backed agency that manages the bank holding to discuss strategic initiatives, including the plan to shrink the investment banking unit. In contrast, bank executives formally meet with other shareholders just four times a year.

		<content>Wall Street Dips After GDP but Finishes Week Higher - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks dipped in thin volume on Friday, though the market had a strong week overall despite a mixed bag of earnings and weak economic figures. Shares of online retailer Amazon.com Inc posted the largest daily drop in 15 months after the company reported results late on Thursday. It was Friday's biggest drag on the SandP 500 and Nasdaq indexes. report, but the decline attracted bargain-hunting investors late in the session. Major indexes posted solid gains for the week. J.C. Penney Co was the SandP 500's biggest percentage gainer, up 11.5 percent to $17 after CNBC reported Goldman Sachs lined up a $1.75 billion loan for the retailer. The news added to previous gains a day after investor George Soros reported a 7.9 percent passive stake in the company. "We traded off a decent amount after the GDP number but we didn't break any technical levels or really didn't get much momentum in the selloff past late morning," said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management in New York. "I guess there was some bottom fishing. There was so much fear of poor earnings going into earnings season that this is still somewhat of a positive surprise." The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.75 points or 0.08 percent, to 14,712.55, the SandP 500 lost 2.92 points or 0.18 percent, to 1,582.24 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.72 points or 0.33 percent, to 3,279.26. Of the 271 companies in the SandP 500 that have reported earnings to date for the first quarter, 69 percent have beaten analyst expectations - above the 63 percent average since 1994 and slightly over the 67 percent beat rate over the past four quarters. Eastman Chemical dropped 5.1 percent to $68.97 a day after posting results, to lead percentage declines among SandP materials, which was the worst performing sector of the index with a 1.4 percent drop. The SandP traded Thursday within a point of its historic closing high set earlier this month and the 1,593 level is expected to be technical resistance in the near future. Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5 percent rate in the first quarter, below estimates of 3 percent, heightening fears the U.S. economy could struggle to cope with deep government spending cuts and higher taxes that kicked in earlier this year. Amazon.com shed 7.2 percent to $254.81 after it said revenue growth slowed in the first quarter as the company struggled overseas, but margins jumped on lower shipping expenses. Chevron rose 1.3 percent to $120.04 after it posted earnings that beat expectations, even as lower oil prices bit into the profits of the second largest U.S. oil company. The PHLX housing sector index gained 1 percent, getting a lift from D.R. Horton Inc after the No. 1 U.S. homebuilder reported earnings. D.R. Horton shares closed at their highest in six years after an 8.7 percent jump to $26.60. About 5.7 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.4 billion shares. On the NYSE, roughly seven issues fell for every five that rose and on Nasdaq about three fell for every two advancing issues.</content>

		<content>Review - BlackBerry Q10, the Keyboard Strikes Back - NYTimes.com One of the coolest features is the "peek." From any application, you can swipe your thumb up from the bottom of the screen, then right, to slide the application slightly off the screen. That reveals the messaging "Hub," which gathers your communications. At a glance, you can see which accounts have new messages. If you want, you can slide the app farther to the right, getting you into the Hub to read and write. Swipe left, and you're back to where you were. The interface takes time to get used to, and it doesn't have the simple immediacy of the iPhone. But once you learn it, you can positively zip between tasks. The downside to the new operating system is its relative dearth of third-party software. There are applications for Facebook, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. A Skype app out will be out soon. But there isn't any app for Netflix, Amazon or eBay. There are no Google apps, either. The selection of games is particularly poor. There's only one incarnation of "Angry Birds," and that's "Star Wars." I also encountered one glitch while using the Q10 for a few days: I was unable to type my response to one email. Leaving it and going back into it did not help until the next day. That's the kind of problem that's going to frustrate BlackBerry users, so I hope it's a rare one, and one the company fixes soon with a software update. That aside, the Q10 is likely to be attractive to the BlackBerry faithful. It deserves to lure some people over from Androids and iPhones as well. The keyboard makes the Q10 a good complement to a tablet. Use the bigger screen for entertainment, surfing and gaming, and the BlackBerry for messaging. When I reviewed the Z10 model in January, I found I couldn't point to anything about it that would make me say: "Forget those other phones: you have to buy this one." I can for the Q10.

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com Victory Spurs Speculation on Bharara’s Next Move  |  With the conviction of Rajat K. Gupta, the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, has now secured the biggest scalp yet in the government’s broad campaign against insider trading on Wall Street. A victory in a case that relied almost entirely on circumstantial evidence is sure to embolden prosecutors in their pursuit of hedge fund traders and their tippers. But after nearly five years of investigations and 60 convictions of hedge fund traders and corporate executives, a question looms for Mr. Bharara and his team of federal prosecutors: Is it time to move on? Several top prosecutors have done just that. Christopher L. Garcia, who helped lead the government’s widespread crackdown of insider trading, left in February. Jonathan R. Streeter, the lead prosecutor in the case against Mr. Rajaratnam, left earlier this year, as did Andrew Michaelson, who was crucial in bringing and prosecuting the Galleon case. And the Gupta trial is expected to be the last for the prosecutor Reed Brodsky, who also prosecuted Mr. Rajaratnam.DealBook » A Conflicted Jury Finds Rajat Gupta Guilty  |  The jury for the insider trading trial of Rajat K.

		<content>Insight - 'Speed Money' Puts the Brakes on India's Retail Growth - NYTimes.com A convenience store that sells basics such as milk, vegetables, cereal, bread, eggs, meat and baby food will require a minimum of 29 licenses from nearly 20 different authorities, according to a list of licenses compiled by the Retailers Association of India and obtained by Reuters. Those include a food license; a license for sale, storage and distribution; a food-handler's certificate; a license for milk products and another for frozen non-vegetarian food. All those licenses comes from the state-level FSSA, but require separate applications. But the FSSA does not give permission for operating freezers and chillers. That requires a separate license from a municipal body. Selling baby food requires a permit from a state Controller of Food and Supply. The state Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee must give permission to sell vegetables; the central Directorate of Marketing and Inspection gives permission to grade and sort those vegetables; the Controller of Rationing grants licenses for selling essential commodities like rice. The Directorate of Marketing and Inspection declined comment, while the other departments were not available. Most of the licenses required can either be done away with completely or combined into one, said Lalit Agarwal, chairman of V-Mart Retail. "Every day, you have new licenses added to the list, but nothing ever gets deleted." It's not just the red tape of getting those licenses, it's also the under-the-table money that retailers typically have to pay on top of the official fees. In Bandra, a high-end suburb of Mumbai, a state-issued trade license for a 10,000-square-foot (930 square-meter) store - very large by Indian standards - officially costs 100,000 rupees ($1,825). But there is an "additional charge" of 1.25 million rupees ($22,800), according to documents obtained by Reuters from the Employee State Insurance, Provident Fund and Industrial Law Practitioners Association of India (EPILPA), which assist retailers in obtaining permits. EPILPA said their members, who are consultants, collect the "speed money" from retailers and pass it on to the government officials. They act as middlemen who do not take a cut and hence should not be held responsible for the bribes being paid. "In India, you don't need to ask retailers if you need to pay bribes," said Punit Agarwal, CEO of Promart, a mid-sized multi-brand clothing retailer. "It's known. Here you have a price tag for everything." He said his company hires middlemen and pays their fees because he knows bribes have to be paid, but does not want his company to get directly involved. Middlemen sell speed. They provide access to government officers who can sign off on permits as soon as they are paid. The middleman negotiates the bribes, thus keeping company officials from being directly involved. Take the case of British footwear retailer Clarks. It entered India through a partnership with Future Group, which runs the country's largest listed retail entity, Future Retail. Clarks has hired consultants and, according to one of them, is negotiating with municipal officials for a 365-day license that would allow it to open three of its five stores in Mumbai every day of the year. For each of the three stores, the company was asked to pay 60,000 rupees ($1,100) per officer for the eight officers involved in its case - a total of 500,000 rupees ($9,100) per store, said Oovesh Sarabhai, of Atlas AVA Consultants, who is working with Clarks to secure the licenses. The official fee is about 6,000 rupees ($110) per store, he said. The government officials involved in issuing the license declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Future and Clarks declined to comment. A senior Clarks official, who declined to be identified, confirmed the company had applied for a 365-day license for the three Mumbai stores in January 2012 and received notifications from the government related to this, but has so far failed to receive the licenses. "It's stuck because of the bureaucracy," the official said. No high-level official dealing with licenses ever accepts a bribe directly, said Raichand Jiwani, owner of Emkay Consultancy Services, who is a member of EPILPA and helps several top Indian retailers to procure licenses. Officials use subordinates to collect the money and only from trusted people. The payment is then shared by junior and senior officers and up the bureaucratic chain. "The nexus runs far deeper than just a few corrupt officials at the local level," said Jiwani, noting that if a retailer approaches an official directly he will not be told about the bribe, but his papers will take months to be approved. While India holds vast promise for retailers, with its growing spending power and rising middle class, most local supermarket chains lose money due to low prices, poor supply chains and high rents. Wal-Mart has said it aims to turn a profit in 10 years, something it hasn't managed in China after 12 years. Tainwala thinks India offers miniscule retail returns for the massive investment of time and energy that is needed. Fast expansion requires paying speed money, he said. Tainwala recalls he was asked to pay either a 22,000 rupee ($400) monthly fee to have signage outside his store in Mumbai's plush Atria mall, or a 2,000 rupee ($36) bribe every month to circumvent it. He said he chose to pack up rather than bribe the municipal officials needed to get his signs approved. "My people said we have to close the stores, and we decided to do that," he said. "You get excited about the Indian middle class but then you wonder - is it really worth it?"</content>

		<content>Settlement Cost for Moody's, SandP, Morgan Stanley Is $225 Million - WSJ - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley and two ratings agencies have agreed to pay about $225 million to settle lawsuits claiming they concealed risks in two mortgage-related deals that collapsed during the financial crisis, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The cost of the settlement will be shared equally among the investment bank and the two ratings firms, Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's, according to the Journal. The lawsuits had accused Moody's, a unit of Moody's Corp, and SandP, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos, of negligent misrepresentation over their activities regarding the Cheyne and Rhinebridge structured investment vehicles (SIVs). Morgan Stanley, which marketed both SIVs and helped structure the Rhinebridge SIV, faced similar accusations. In both cases, investors accused the ratings agencies of collaborating with banks in arranging for SIVs to receive ratings as high as "triple-A," even though much of the underlying collateral was low-quality or subprime mortgage debt. The cases are Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank et al v. Morgan Stanley and Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-07508; and King County, Washington et al v. IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG et al in the same court, No. 09-08387</content>

		<content>Qlik, Informatica Raise Revenue Outlooks, Shares Jump - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Informatica Corp and Qlik Technologies Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and the business software makers raised their full-year revenue forecasts as enterprises spent more on integrating and analyzing data. While tech spending has been weak and traditional software companies have suffered, companies that make software to manage, process and analyze data have found favor as customers look to mine data for real time answers to their problems, boosting efficiency and cutting costs. "We benefited from broad-based customer demand with key wins in multiple vertical segments, including financial services, public sector, manufacturing and healthcare," Informatica CEO Sohaib Abbasi said on a conference call with analysts. The company, which makes software to help companies integrate data from various sources, raised its full-year revenue forecast to $885 million-$925 million, from $850 million-$900 million. Abbasi said the company's North American business, which accounts for more than two-thirds of its revenue, was very strong, while Europe remained challenging. Informatica reported a 15 percent increase in its services business in the first quarter, while total revenue of $214.3 million was ahead of analysts' estimates of $202.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Informatica's shares rose more than 8 percent to $35 in extended trading while those of peer Qlik rose 14 percent to $27.10. "We continue to benefit from sales process improvements ..., expanded service and support offerings, and ongoing momentum across our partner network," Qlik's CEO Lars Björk said. Qlik raised its 2013 profit forecast range by 2 cents per share and now expects 41 cents to 44 cents per share. It also raised its full-year revenue range by $6 million and expects revenue of $471 million to $481 million. License revenue for the first quarter rose to $52.7 million. Total revenue rose 22 percent to $96.5 million.</content>

		<content>John McAfee Plays Hide-and-Seek in Belize - NYTimes.com A real estate agent in Ambergris Caye named Chris Allnatt woke up at his home the next morning at 5:30 and was amazed to find Mr. McAfee asleep on his balcony, pants soaked with urine. Mr. McAfee had been renting the condo next door, and he later told Wired magazine that he high-tailed it after 30 to 40 police officers and Coast Guard personnel came for him in the middle of the night. He had traversed a narrow ledge, in the dark, 20 feet above the ground to reach Mr. Allnatt’s balcony. Mr. McAfee would later fall back on his go-to explanation for all bizarre behavior: he was kidding. He contended on his blog that he was merely playing a joke on Mr. Allnatt, who happens to be the agent who sold him that Mata Grande villa. “I was scammed to the max on the deal and merely filed away in my mind that the score should someday be settled in an amicable and amusing (for me) fashion that benefited me in some way,” he wrote. How showing up asleep on Mr. Allnatt’s balcony is supposed to settle a score, or amuse anyone, is a mystery. But Mr. Allnatt’s version of this episode, you may not be surprised to learn, is a little different. There were no police officers or Coast Guard personnel around that evening, he said. He would have heard them. Also, Mr. Allnatt said he believes that Mr. McAfee “was messed up on drugs.” “When he woke up, he was all over the place, and later when my wife looked around the balcony, she found a little Ziploc bag filled with gray powder, which he’d hidden among our plants,” Mr. Allnatt said. “I almost considered calling and demanding an apology because we don’t do drugs. I don’t care if others do, but how dare he bring it on our property?” He said he washed the contents of the bag down a drain and would never have discussed it if Mr. McAfee hadn’t told the story to Wired. Mr. McAfee’s isolation and sense of despair would quickly deepen. About a week before the murder, said Mr. Wade, his driver, he fired his four bodyguards because he thought they were talking to the government. (In their place, he hired a British man.) When Mr. McAfee’s dogs were poisoned, on Friday, Nov. 9, he e-mailed Mr. Davis, the Wired reporter, and wrote that “a contingent of black-suited thugs” had swarmed the beach near his home. “A half-hour later,” he said, “all of my dogs had been poisoned.” Soon after Mr. Faull was found dead, that Sunday morning, police officers arrived at Mr. McAfee’s house. He would later contend that he eluded them by digging a hole, covering it with a cardboard box and lying still for hours. He accused Belizean authorities of the murder, figuring that they came to kill him and shot the wrong white guy. The government said this was ludicrous. THE phone rang while I was shaving. “This is John McAfee. I understand you want to talk to me. You’ve got four minutes. This is a third-world country but they can still triangulate a call.” I had left my number with Mr. Essley and asked him to forward it to Mr. McAfee with a request for an interview. Ten minutes later, the interview had begun. I asked how he was faring, presumably in circumstances that were relatively austere. “I’m doing fine under the circumstances,” he said. “I’m eating fairly normally. I can survive on bananas, and peanut butter and canned food.” He sounded assured, serious and determined. There was no hint of the jokester who liked to wear disguises or grab his crotch for photographs. Does he have any idea who killed his dogs? “The only person I know who didn’t do it is Greg Faull,” he said, “because he loved dogs and people who love dogs don’t kill other people’s dogs.” I asked if it wasn’t crazy to think that the Belize police would kill him, now that his case had attracted so much media attention. “I would like to point something out. Research Arthur Young,” he said, referring to a gang leader who was reportedly shot dead by police after he’d been apprehended. “Police were saying, ‘We only want to talk to you.’ They handcuffed his hands behind his back. You know very little about the police and the judicial system here.” He then theorized that if he turned himself in, the police might well take him into custody and hang him using his pants, making it look like a suicide. The call ended. As of late Friday, Mr. McAfee was still evading the 20 police officers and members of the Gang Suppression Unit that are said to be looking for him. He has been tapping out a steady flow of words and updates on his blog, and projecting an air of contented defiance. Recently, that he and Sam had been secreted into the home of a friend and had enjoyed a bath and a cup of coffee. To a modest segment of San Pedro, he is a kind of folk hero, outwitting a crooked and feckless government that has failed to provide much in the way of economic opportunity. To others, he’s a tragic case of a superior mind gone haywire. He needs help, they say, and if he is really innocent, he should get it, as soon as possible. To still others, he’s a publicity seeker, par excellence. Mr. Spiegel, the Rojo Lounge owner, has a simple, low-budget plan to drive him out of hiding. “The police should declare him a person of noninterest,” Mr. Spiegel says. “Soon as they do that, he’ll be knocking on their door.” A picture caption last Sunday with an article about the founder of a Silicon Valley virus-fighting software company who was sought by the police in Belize in connection with a homicide investigation misspelled his surname. He is John McAfee, not McAfree.</content>

		<content>Can Main Street Win Business Plan Competitions? - NYTimes.com Scott Squire Ryan Schmid, founder of Vera Fitness Business plan competitions tend to emphasize technology. Many competitions, like Nokia’s Mobile Rules Contest and those held by Rice University and the Hong Kong University of Sciences and Technology, either prefer or require plans in the fields of life sciences, clean technology, aerospace, mobile or information technology. Same thing with public economic development offices that hold competitions — like the Alabama Launchpad and the Rochester Regional Business Plan Competition — to create jobs and wealth in their regions. More examples can be found in our guide. All of which explains why entrepreneurs like Shobha Tummala, chief executive of the Shobha hair removal salons and products company in Manhattan, choose not to bother with competitions. Said Ms. Tummala, who thought about entering one while getting her M.B.A. at Harvard, “It’s hard to demonstrate the scale investors or judges who act like investors would want if you have a retail company, like mine, that will not grow into a McDonald’s-sized franchise.” But there are competitions now that encourage and reward service, consumables and other non-tech companies — though their numbers are fewer and their winners get less attention. These include: standalones, like the yearly Good Neighbor Pharmacy Business Plan Competition held by the National Community Pharmacists’ Association to promote independent pharmacy ownership, and separate tracks within larger competitions, like the Morehouse College Business Plan Competition, which has a best “consumable industry” prize alongside “energy,” and “science and technology.” Some schools including Temple University and Babson College, host events that claim no industry bias. The Rebecca Davis Dance Company, a traveling dance company and school in Philadelphia, won at Temple in 2004 and is still thriving today. And Lazy Bones, a laundry pickup, drop-off and storage service catering to college students won $20,000 cash from Babson’s 2009 graduate business plan competition. The chief development officer at Lazy Bones, Joel Pedlikin, left a career in aerospace engineering to help the co-founders Dan Hermann and Reg Mathelier build the business. “There’s a mind-set going into the M.B.A. program and competitions that you have to do something with computers or biotech,” said Mr. Pedlikin. “But you can make more money in a vanilla service business sometimes.” In a memorable competition in the spring of 2007, two entrepreneurs faced off in the finals of the Seattle University business plan competition. One was high-tech, the other more Main Street. The high-tech company was pitched by Brayden Olson, who was building Novel Interactive, a “massively multiplayer” online game maker. Its games would eschew fantasy and shoot-em-up content, drawing instead on political and business themes. Some would serve as entertainment, others as “flight simulators” to help business owners and city planners make hiring decisions and build projects wisely. The Main Street company was pitched by Ryan Schmid, who was building Vera Fitness, a “women’s wellness center” with a green philosophy. It would preach and practice sustainable fitness by offering an energy-efficient gym and using local, recycled and other low-impact materials and foods in its training programs. Perhaps surprisingly, Novel Interactive’s Mr. Olson felt he was the underdog going into the finals. He knew that his plan would be subject to scoring by a mix of community leaders, educators and entrepreneurs, and in one round, a semi-public audience invited by the school. He feared that while entrepreneurs might see the potential of massively multiplayer gaming, still new in North America in 2007, others might prefer the “relatable” to the “visionary.” When he pitched, Mr. Olson highlighted the social and educational value of his games and tried simplifying technical details. Mr. Schmid of Vera Fitness likewise considered himself the underdog. He feared that a competitor like Novel Interactive, and those with what he calls “cure-for-cancer” concepts, would make his wellness center seem pedestrian. He emphasized the company’s foundations in environmental science, and his experience setting up a not-for-profit health center in a low-income community outside Seattle. And the winner was: Vera Fitness, which used its $10,000 purse to open shop. Novel Interactive was able to launch too, but more slowly. It has yet to generate revenue from games, and plans to release its first in beta this July. Instead, Mr. Olson took on a consulting project developing an online community for his mentor, Bill George, former chief executive of Medtronic, to generate capital. He landed a Global Student Entrepreneur Award for his efforts and aptitude in 2009, and an incubator spot for Novel Interactive at Gas Powered Games, makers of Dungeon Siege and Supreme Commander, in Redmond, Wash. Meanwhile, Vera Fitness, which opened in March 2008, is already generating revenue from the services it pitched at competition. The company, says Mr. Schmid, broke even in the second half of 2009 and is on track to be profitable and at least double its revenue in 2010. Memberships are up. And business is good enough that the chief executive is now looking for corporate office space in downtown Seattle. Vera Fitness recently added corporate health services to its offerings. Under the brand name Motif, its representatives go to corporate campuses to teach nutrition, stress management and fitness. The service is meant to help companies raise employee morale and realize savings on insurance. See The Prize’s Business Plan Competition Guide.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com As an Adviser, Goldman Guaranteed Its Payday  |  Lloyd C. Blankfein had a script prepared for his phone call with Douglas L. Foshee, chief executive of the El Paso Corporation, the big energy company that last fall was in talks to be sold to Kinder Morgan, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column. “I was very pleased you reached out to us on this most recent matter,” the script goes, thanking Mr. Foshee for using Goldman Sachs as El Paso’s adviser in the transaction. Somewhat awkwardly, Goldman had a 19.1 percent stake in Kinder Morgan, the pipeline and energy storage company, and two seats on its board. So the script said, “We have asked our board members to recuse themselves and I know you have taken on a second adviser.” About a month later, Kinder Morgan announced it had agreed to acquire El Paso for $21.1 billion in cash and stock. When the deal was announced, buried at the end of the news release was a list of Wall Street banks that had advised on the deal, including Goldman Sachs. Goldman received a $20 million fee for playing matchmaker for El Paso. The fee, of course, was not disclosed, nor was the Kinder Morgan stake owned by Goldman Sachs’s private equity arm, worth some $4 billion. Nor did the release disclose that the Goldman banker who advised El Paso to accept Kinder Morgan’s bid owned $340,000 worth of Kinder Morgan stock. Now, however, a court ruling in a shareholder lawsuit has laid bare the truth: Goldman was on every conceivable side of the deal. As a result, El Paso may have unwittingly sold itself far too cheaply.

		<content>Intel's CEO Pick Sticks to Tried-And-True Formula - NYTimes.com SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In picking Brian Krzanich as its next CEO, Intel Corp. stuck to a familiar playbook amid a game-changing shift in computing that has raised worries about the future of the world's largest chipmaker. Ever since Intel co-founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore ceded their roles as the first two CEOs, the company has always promoted the second-in-command to the helm. That started in 1987 with Andy Grove, who served as the top lieutenant under the co-founders. After learning the ropes under Grove, Craig Barrett took over as CEO in 1998 and then handed the reins to his understudy, Paul Otellini, in 2005. Krzanich, Intel's chief operating officer, was named its sixth CEO on Thursday. He will start in two weeks. The succession formula worked well in a computing market dominated by desktop and laptop machines that ran on Intel's microprocessors and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system. But if there is a time to break from that tradition, this would be it. Traditionally strong in personal computers, Intel is facing a threat from smartphones and tablet computers, which demand lower-energy processors that Intel is late to master. "We are a little disappointed that the board didn't bring in new blood at this critical juncture for the company," Wedbush Securities analyst Betsy Van Hees said. "We have seen a pretty significant shift in the tide, and they are now navigating some pretty tough currents. It would have been nice to have a fresh pair of eyes." PC sales are declining as businesses and consumers embrace mobile computers — most of which don't rely on Intel's chips. Microsoft has even created a lightweight version of Windows that isn't well suited for Intel's processors. The upheaval contributed to a 15 percent decline in Intel's profit last year. Intel has been scrambling to develop power-sipping chips and designs better suited for the needs of mobile devices. But even if that effort is successful, the company's profit margins may be squeezed. That's because mobile chips sell for much less than PC chips. Some analysts believe that Otellini, who is 62, decided to retire early because of the industry turmoil. The board had expected him to remain CEO until he turns 65 in 2015. "It's time to move on and transfer Intel's helm to a new generation of leadership," Otellini said in November when he disclosed his plans to leave. His retirement created an opportunity for the Santa Clara, Calif., company to hire an outsider as CEO for the first time in its 45-year history. Although external candidates were considered during the six-month search, the board concluded that Krzanich is the best leader to tackle the mobile computing challenge. Krzanich, who is 52 and spent his entire career at the company, comes out of a manufacturing organization where meticulous attention is required to churn out processors with billions of minute details. Just because Intel promoted from within doesn't mean there won't be changes, RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman said. He believes Intel plans to become less focused on engineering technological breakthroughs so it concentrate on helping its customers develop their products. "Our view is Krzanich's appointment was awarded as a result of changes in the future direction of the company, with these changes expected to become visible over the next few quarters," Freedman said. Investors evidently weren't disillusioned with Intel's CEO choice, which had been widely expected. Intel's stock rose 12 cents to close Thursday at $24.11. Krzanich isn't inheriting Otellini's title of president. It will go instead to software chief Renee James, 48, creating a two-person "executive office" at the head of the company. Gartner Inc. analyst Sergis Mushell believes one of the reasons Intel promotes from within is because of the difficulty finding outsiders capable of running a business with the size and complexity of Intel. The company generates $53 billion in annual revenue, employs 105,000 people and operates dozens of offices and plants around the world.</content>

		<content>JPMorgan's Friction With Washington - NYTimes.com Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools JPMORGAN’S FRICTION WITH WASHINGTON  |  It was not long ago that JPMorgan Chase and its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, held special sway in Washington. But that status may be fading, as the bank “increasingly finds itself in the cross hairs of federal authorities,” Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Ben Protess report in DealBook. The criminal inquiry over the big trading loss last year joins other legal tangles. “In a previously undisclosed case, prosecutors are examining whether JPMorgan failed to fully alert authorities to suspicions about Bernard L. Madoff, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter.” In addition, “JPMorgan misstated how the bank may have harmed more than 5,000 homeowners in foreclosure, according to several people briefed on the matter. The bank’s primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is expected to collect a cash payment from the bank to remedy the flawed review of loans, these people say.” Those mortgage errors, while relatively minor on their own, highlight the growing friction with regulators. Eight federal agencies are investigating JPMorgan, and federal prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are examining potential wrongdoing. In April, senior JPMorgan executives, including Mr. Dimon, are expected to meet with investigators examining the multibillion-dollar trading loss that was the focus of a recent Senate report, people briefed on the matter said. “Jamie and other executives feel terrible that the bank’s self-inflicted mistakes have put regulators in an awkward position,” said Joe Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman. “We are wholly to blame for our errors and are fully cooperating with all authorities to make things right.” COHEN’S BIG ART DEAL  |  Steven A. Cohen has not let an insider trading investigation — or an elbow — put a stop to his art dealings. “A renowned art collector, Mr. Cohen has bought Picasso’s ‘Le Rêve’ from the casino owner Stephen A. Wynn for $155 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the sale who was not authorized to speak publicly,” Carol Vogel and Peter Lattman report in DealBook. Mr. Cohen, who has coveted the painting for years, agreed to buy it from Mr. Wynn for $135 million in 2006, but that deal was called off after Mr. Wynn, who has an eye disease, put his elbow through it. An art restorer repaired the canvas and apparently restored the painting’s value. The art deal was reported earlier by The New York Post. Mr. Cohen is effectively $616 million poorer after his hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, settled with the government over accusations of insider trading. But he has continued to add to his world-class art collection, which includes works by Jackson Pollock, Monet and Manet. The purchase of “Le Rêve” is at least the second $100 million-plus acquisition of art by Mr. Cohen in the last two years. BRITISH BANKS’ CAPITAL HOLE  |  British banks need to raise a combined £25 billion ($38 billion) in new capital by the end of the year to protect against future shocks, local authorities said on Wednesday. “The Bank of England, which takes over the direct supervision of British firms like HSBC and Barclays next week, said the new reserves were needed to protect against losses connected to risky loan portfolios, future regulatory fines and the rejiggering of banks’ bloated balance sheets,” DealBook’s Mark Scott writes. For most American banks, the Federal Reserve’s stress tests showed they had sufficient capital to withstand a major downturn. “British banks are not so lucky,” Mr. Scott says. ON THE AGENDA  |  Pinnacle Foods, owned by the Blackstone Group, is expected to price its I.P.O. Wednesday evening. Data on pending home sales for February is out at 10 a.m. Robert Benmosche, A.I.G.’s chief executive, is on CNBC at 8 a.m. A bankruptcy judge is set to rule on final approval of the merger of American Airlines and US Airways. FORECASTS DARKEN FOR CYPRUS  |  The plan to rescue Cyprus is being complicated by a gloomy economic forecast. “Instead of the relatively modest decline of 3 percent that is built into the forecast that underpins the country’s international bailout package, many economists say that estimate will need to be revised sharply downward given the shock that the island’s small economy has endured from the extended closure of its banks,” The New York Times’s Landon Thomas Jr. writes. Paul Krugman, the economist and columnist for The New York Times, says, “Cyprus should leave the euro. Now.” He continues: “The reason is straightforward: staying in the euro means an incredibly severe depression, which will last for many years while Cyprus tries to build a new export sector. Leaving the euro, and letting the new currency fall sharply, would greatly accelerate that rebuilding.”  |  Contact: @williamalden | E-mail Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.

		<content>Microsoft-Yahoo: What Everyone's Talking About - NYTimes.com Article Tools The campaign for a combined Microsoft-Yahoo appears to be dead (for now, anyway). As perhaps the biggest tech/Internet media story of the past 12 months, the demise of the deal understandably has generated a lot of talk on the blogosphere. It’s certainly gotten a rise out of many DealBook readers, who have left more than 280 comments on the Yahoo deal’s demise since Saturday night. Here’s a roundup of some of the chatter on other blogs. * Dinging the whole affair as something out of Monty Python’s “Life of Brian,” Paul Kedrosky runs down the list of losers on his Infectious Greed blog. Among the “collateral damage” are folks like Bill Miller of Legg Mason, whose fund’s improving performance this year stemmed in large part from his position in both Microsoft and Yahoo. Other arbitrageurs, or investors who bet on the outcomes of mergers, are also likely to be singed. * Over on Silicon Alley Insider, Henry Blodget speculates that the real winner of the collapsed bid may not be either Microsoft or Yahoo. In fact, it may be Jeff Bewkes of Time Warner: The media conglomerate could now entertain a bidding war between the two sides for its AOL unit. And in that potential fight, Mr. Blodget writes, it’s pretty clear who would win. * On TechCrunch, Erick Schonfeld speculates that Steven Ballmer’s position as Microsoft’s chief executive is a bit more tenuous today. After the rocky debut of Windows Vista, Mr. Ballmer latched onto the Yahoo deal as the game-changer he needed for redemption. If he is kicked out, Microsoft may have to bring back Bill Gates as interim chief executive while it looks for a permanent replacement. * That may be a little difficult, according to Valleywag‘s Owen Thomas, who writes that he’s also seen a lot of correspondence flying out of Redmond. A replacement for Mr. Ballmer might not come from inside Microsoft for various reasons, he writes. * DealBook has previously said that Mr. Ballmer’s performance in the Yahoo negotiations would be highly scrutinized, and missteps may lead some to question his leadership. * It’s worth remembering, however, that the Yahoo bid wasn’t universally loved within Microsoft. Many employees viewed it as a distraction — much as Jerry Yang at Yahoo did — and they may be relieved that the matter has faded. Before the news broke on Saturday, Mr. Blodget noted that if Microsoft succeeded in acquiring Yahoo, it would have to make a lot of painful cuts in its own Internet brands, including Windows Live and Hotmail. * There’s lighter matter, too. Portfolio‘s Jack Flack takes his magnifying glass to the press releases both Microsoft and Yahoo put out Saturday night. Here’s a sampling of his translation work. From Microsoft’s letter: Ballmer: I am disappointed that Yahoo! has not moved towards accepting our offer. Translation: There will be blood. From Yahoo’s response: Yahoo: Our solid results for the first quarter of 2008 and increased full year 2008 operating cash flow outlook reflect the progress the company is making. Translation: Please don’t ask us about the 12 quarters before that. * Anticipating a probable plunge in the price of Yahoo shares, Barry Ritholtz of The Big Picture highlights a waggish post on Yahoo’s message board about … well, itself. The comment explores an unexpected angle: the Federal Reserve’s (fictional) role. Here’s an excerpt: In response to recent events Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to authorize the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to create Yahoo Lending Facility (YLF) to avoid significant stock market distruption and to support Yahoo! Inc shares. Go to DealBook’s Full Coverage of Microsoft’s Yahoo Bid »</content>

		<content>LinkedIn's Disappointing Outlook Eclipses Big 1Q - NYTimes.com SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — LinkedIn's rapidly rising stock got demoted late Thursday after the online professional networking service released a forecast calling for its earnings growth to slow later this year as the company hires more workers, invests in data centers and tweaks the way that it shows online ads. The predicted deceleration overshadowed another stellar performance during the first three months of the year. As has been the case in every reporting period since LinkedIn Corp. went public two years ago, both the company's first-quarter earnings and revenue topped the analyst estimates that steer Wall Street expectations. But management's projections for both the current quarter ending in June and the full year came in below analyst projections, rattling investors who have become accustomed to LinkedIn delivering nothing but pleasant surprises. The letdown dampened the feverish interest in LinkedIn's stock, which surpassed $200 for the first time Thursday. After closing at $201.67, LinkedIn's shares tumbled $20.45, or more than 10 percent, to $181.22 in extended trading. Even if the sell-off carries through into Friday's regular trading session, LinkedIn's stock still will have more than quadrupled from its initial public offering price of $45. As of Thursday's close, the shares had surged by 76 percent so far this year compared to a 12 percent gain for the Standard and Poor's 500 index. LinkedIn has thrived by establishing itself as the go-to place for employers to find talented workers and for people to get job tips and other advice to manage their careers. It doesn't cost anything for people to set up a professional profile on the site. The Mountain View, Calif., company makes most of its money by charging employers and headhunters for analytical tools and additional access to LinkedIn profiles and the site, such as the ability to send messages to users. LinkedIn is now adding more content, giving its audience more reasons to return to its website more frequently and to stay for longer periods. The company hopes that will lead to more advertising to supplement its revenue. As part of that process, LinkedIn plans to place more ads within the stream of the personal updates appearing in the middle of its members' individual pages rather displaying them on the sides. The switch is a strategy already used by social networking leader Facebook Inc. and online messaging service Twitter to make it easier to show ads on mobile devices. LinkedIn plans to make the transition gradually to minimize the chances of irritating its members, CEO Jeff Weiner told analysts during a Thursday conference call. LinkedIn's profits also will be lowered by the expenses for expanding the company's payroll and building data centers to run its online services. "There are some incremental investments coming into play," Steve Sordello, LinkedIn's chief financial officer, told analysts during the conference call. LinkedIn earned $22.6 million, or 20 cents per share, in the first quarter. That's up from $5 million, or 4 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were 45 cents per share in the latest quarter, well above analysts' expectations of 30 cents, based on a poll by FactSet. Revenue grew 72 percent from last year to nearly $325 million — about $7 million above analyst projections. LinkedIn expects second-quarter revenue between $342 million and $347 million for the April-June period. Analysts had forecast $360 million. For the full year, LinkedIn believes its revenue will range from $1.43 billion to $1.46 billion. That's $20 million more than the company had predicted a few months ago, but analysts have been counting on full-year revenue of $1.5 billion. Another figure that troubled investors is LinkedIn's forecast for its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. This measure provides an inkling of how much money the company is likely to make. LinkedIn expects full-year EBITDA of $330 million to $345 million for the full year, below analysts' expectations of $363 million.</content>

		<content>Tuning in to Cultural Nuances - NYTimes.com In 1994 I was working for a cable television company in Boston, and they were doing a joint venture in Singapore. I asked whether there was an opportunity to be involved. After not hearing back for several weeks, one day the general manager of the joint venture called up and offered me a job, but I was told I only had 24 hours to make up my mind. It was less of a culture shock than I expected, without really knowing what to expect. Singapore was already pretty vibrant and I suppose I found it somewhat exhilarating. It was pretty clear upon arrival there were going to be a lot of opportunities in Asia. I don’t think I was a very good manager when I started. I made plenty of mistakes during those early days. Over time I learned to manage more than one country —at Fox we’re in over 14 markets. The styles of doing business, managing people and leading teams can be dramatically different between the various markets. At least when you go to Latin America there are some similarities between the countries, there are only two languages and there is a Latin culture, but Asia is far from a single culture and there are far fewer similarities from one country to the next. I guess pretty typical: being a rash American, and maybe less sensitive to the cultural issues. It’s hard to pinpoint, but certain aspects of communication. For certain things Asians can be incredibly direct, even more so than Americans, but for others, they are far more reserved. I’m not particularly good at foreign languages, although I’ve learned a bit of Japanese and Mandarin. But I’ve invested my energy in trying to learn the cultures of the countries and the different nuances between them. For instance, some people think Japan and Korea are alike, but in reality they’re almost at the opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of how local executives think about and go about business. In Korea, I find our team and the business people we interact with to be very intense about doing business, incredibly hard-working and committed to the cause on a daily basis. The Japanese are equally successful and committed, but they try hard to find the consensus before moving forward. As a result, they come across less aggressive day to day, even if they are committed over the long haul to getting to the goal line. Q. Your company has focused on decentralizing power and finding local managers. How do you find that this works? In the early days we didn’t have a lot of money or resources, so some of this was made out of necessity. It was less expensive to hire someone locally based than bring someone over from the U.S. or Europe. But soon we realized that if we found locally based talent with the right skills and mind-set and who were hard-working, and we gave them a real sense of ownership over the business, that they could move at a much faster speed than even a very talented expatriate. In the media industry, many still believe they’re building a regional business, but we don’t see it like that. We’re building local businesses. Culturally and business-wise it’s hard to get people up to speed quickly. It doesn’t mean we don’t bring expats in, but they have usually already lived in Asia. We’re looking for people who can build and lead the organization, as we’re still in the development stage. It’s about inspiring a strong level of performance and instilling positive values. You need genuine people with a strong grounding. I’ve been involved in a lot of hiring, directly or indirectly, and I’ve been fortunate to be surrounded by talented people who can do the same. So you have a multiplying effect. I’m a very hands-on person, but it’s impossible in my role to be hands-on completely every day. What I’ve learned is that it’s better to come in and focus fully on one thing, whether for half a day or a day, than try to juggle 50 balls. It’s more efficient to be that way. I also like to encourage direct interaction between different parts of the business. If you have a great team in Malaysia and a great team in Taiwan, you should encourage direct interaction between these teams, instead of coming through a central clearinghouse.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com TOP STORIES Regulators’ Shake-Up Seen as Missed Bid to Police a Bank  |  After the financial crisis, regulators vowed to overhaul supervision of the nation’s largest banks. As part of that effort, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in mid-2011 replaced virtually all of its roughly 40 examiners at JPMorgan Chase to bolster the team’s expertise and prevent regulators from forming cozy ties with executives, according to several current and former government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But those changes left the New York Fed’s front-line examiners without deep knowledge of JPMorgan’s operations for a brief yet critical time, said those people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because there is a federal investigation of the bank. Forced to play catch-up, the examiners struggled to understand the inner workings of a powerful investment unit, those officials said. At first, the examiners sought basic information about the group, including the name of the unit’s core trading portfolio. By the time they got up to speed, it was too late. In May, JPMorgan disclosed a multibillion-dollar trading loss in the investment unit. DealBook »   Dentsu of Japan to Buy Aegis of Britain for $5.1 Billion  |  Dentsu, a Japanese advertising powerhouse that has struggled to expand internationally, made a big leap into Western markets on Thursday, saying it had agreed to buy Aegis, an agency company based in London. The planned acquisition, valued at £3.2 billion ($5.1 billion), is one of the largest ever in the advertising business, rivaling the purchase of Young and Rubicam by the WPP Group 12 years ago, and a deal for the parent company of Leo Burnett by the Publicis Groupe in 2002. It would combine the fifth-largest advertising company in the world, Dentsu, with the seventh largest. Aegis specializes in media buying, a steady source of earnings, and fast-growing digital marketing, leaving slower-growing businesses like the creation of television advertising to other agencies.

		<content>Another Departure at JPMorgan - NYTimes.com Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools Frank J. Bisignano, co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase, is leaving the bank to become chief executive of the payment processing firm First Data Corporation, according to a statement on Sunday by the bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon. Matthew E. Zames, who shared the chief operating officer role with Mr. Bisignano, will take over all aspects of the job, effective immediately, Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports in DealBook. Mr. Bisignano’s move, the latest executive departure since JPMorgan reported a multibillion-dollar trading loss last year, is voluntary, according to two people close to the bank, who added that the First Data post would be a perfect role for him. “His departure is less fraught than others during more tumultuous periods, these people say. Ina R. Drew, who ran the chief investment office, the unit at the center of the huge trading loss, resigned under pressure in May last year, for example,” Ms. Silver-Greenberg writes. “With Mr. Bisignano’s departure, the ranks of executives who once surrounded Mr. Dimon as he helped steer the bank through the 2008 financial crisis will be even thinner.” SANTANDER CHIEF RESIGNS  |  The chief executive of Banco Santander, Alfredo Sáenz, resigned on Monday, days after the Spanish bank reported that first-quarter net profit fell 26 percent. Mr. Sáenz, 70, who joined Santander in 1994, will be succeeded by Javier Marín Romano, currently head of the firm’s insurance, asset management and private banking operations. Mr. Sáenz resigned after a long-running series of legal problems, DealBook’s Mark Scott writes. HIGH COSTS FOR PENSION LOANS  |  Companies offering so-called pension advances to retirees are drawing scrutiny from Congress and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Ms. Silver-Greenberg reports. “The advances, federal and state authorities say, are not advances at all, but carefully disguised loans that require borrowers to sign over all or part of their monthly pension checks. They carry interest rates that are often many times higher than those on credit cards.” “A review by The New York Times of more than two dozen contracts for pension-based loans found that after factoring in various fees, the effective interest rates ranged from 27 percent to 106 percent — information not disclosed in the ads or in the contracts themselves. Furthermore, to qualify for one of the loans, borrowers are sometimes required to take out a life insurance policy that names the lender as the sole beneficiary.” A BULLISH CASE FOR DELL  |  The proposed buyout of Dell, which faces opposition from investors like Southeastern Asset Management and Carl C. Icahn, may not be the most lucrative option for investors, Barron’s writes. With Dell’s stock trading below the $13.65-a-share buyout offer from Michael S. Dell and Silver Lake, “the view on the Street seems to be that if the deal dies, Dell shares will head lower, perhaps as low as $10 or $11,” the magazine writes. “Dell shares now look appealing because investors stand to make a small profit if the Michael Dell-led offer gets approved. And the alternatives to that offer — which would allow Dell to remain a public company — could provide significant value to shareholders, since Icahn and Southeastern value Dell at more than $20 per share.” “Given the opposition, there’s a good chance the deal dies even if an Icahn proposal doesn’t materialize. That would be welcome news for Dell investors, who could then benefit from alternatives that offer immediate and long-term benefits that probably far exceed $13.65 a share.” ON THE AGENDA  |  Herbalife, a company at the center of a battle among Wall Street titans, reports earnings after the market closes. A report on personal income and outlays in March is out at 8:30 a.m. Data on pending home sales in March is out at 10 a.m. The investor Peter Thiel is on CNBC at 3:10 p.m. Peter Weinberg, co-founder of Perella Weinberg Partners, is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m. CLASH OVER EMPIRE STATE BUILDING GOES TO COURT  |  A fight over the future of the Empire State Building will play out in court starting on Monday, when the New York real estate barons Peter L. Malkin and his son Anthony E. Malkin, who control the tower but are minority owners, argue that it should be taken public. “They are within a whisker of landing the deal of a lifetime, valued at $5.2 billion, that would offer to the public shares in 19 properties in the New York area that they oversee, including the crown jewel, the Empire State Building,” The New York Times writes. “The offering would catapult the Malkin family into the elite of Manhattan real estate, valuing their stake at an estimated $730 million and installing Anthony Malkin as chairman of a major new company, Empire State Realty Trust.” “But standing in their way is an eclectic group of dissenters led by the California businessman Richard Edelman and Andrew S. Penson, a speculative investor who owns Grand Central Terminal.” The hostility has surprised even some longtime observers of the industry. “I’m amazed at the level of enmity,” said Barry Vinocur, the editor at a trade publisher, REIT Zone Publications. “I can’t recall ever seeing anything like it.”  |  Contact: @williamalden | E-mail Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.   Mergers and Acquisitions » Valeant and Actavis Talks Fall Through, for Now  |  The two companies had been in talks for some time, and under the most recent terms of the proposed deal, Valeant would have paid more than $13 billion in stock to acquire Actavis, this person said.

		<content>Baidu First-Quarter Profit Misses Wall Street Targets - NYTimes.com SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Baidu Inc, China's largest search engine, posted its slowest profit growth in more than four years, missing Wall Street targets as higher traffic acquisition costs ate into profit margins and the company consolidated results from its money-losing online video unit. Shares of Baidu, which have fallen about 12 percent since the start of the year, were down more than 6 percent at $85.80 in after hours trading on Thursday. Revenue in the first quarter rose 40 percent to $961 million, short of the $969.3 million expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income in the three months ended March 31 increased 8.5 percent year-on-year to $328.9 million, or 95 cents per American Depositary Share, short of the $1.03 per ADS analysts had expected. Baidu's softer results this quarter were due to the consolidation of its online video unit, iQiyi, to its overall business. Analysts said they do not envision iQiyi being profitable in the near future given the high costs of the online video sector. Baidu also had to pay more for traffic acquisition due to competition from Qihoo 360 Technology's search engine. For the second quarter, Baidu estimated revenue of $1.187 billion to $1.216 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had an average forecast of $1.2 billion. (Reporting by Alexei Oreskovic in San Francisco and Melanie Lee in Shanghai; Editing by Richard Chang)</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com For Wall Street Overseer, Progress Comes at a Crawl  |  Leading a new federal agency intended to help prevent another financial crisis may seem like a dream job for most economic gurus, but the government made a nomination only last month after a painfully slow search process. The Treasury Department first considered at least three other candidates during the 17-month hunt for a director of the new agency, the Office of Financial Research. But they all rebuffed the job, in part over fears about the contentious Congressional approval process. The White House finally identified the in-house nominee — Richard Berner, a counselor to the Treasury secretary who was formerly chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley — in a little-noticed news release late on a Friday in December. “I was a little frustrated” by the process, said Lewis S.

		<content>How the Video Games Industry Is Faring - NYTimes.com Companies in the video games industry have begun releasing earnings reports for the latest quarter. Here's a look at selected companies that make or sell video games or machines. — April 3: Mobile game developer Rovio Entertainment Ltd. says the popular Angry Birds franchise helped it double revenue in 2012 to 152 million euros ($195 million). Net income surged more than 55 percent to 55.5 million euros ($71.2 million). — April 18: Microsoft Corp. says revenue from its Xbox 360 business grew by $641 million, or 55 percent, in the January-March quarter. That's from higher revenue from its Xbox Live service and the recognition of $380 million in deferred video game revenue. Revenue is deferred when video games are sold with software upgrades and enhancements. Like other video game companies, Microsoft spreads that out over time, while the game is played, rather than all at once. — April 24: Zynga Inc.'s surprise profit in the first three months of the year gets overshadowed by a revenue decline, a drop in the number of users and a lower-than-expected second-quarter forecast. The online games company manages a small profit of $4.1 million, or breakeven per share, by cutting expenses. CEO Mark Pincus says 2013 will "continue to be a transition year." Nintendo Co. says it returned to profit for the fiscal year that ended March 31 as a lift from the weakening yen offset sales struggles caused by software delays for its latest home console, Wii U. Both profit and sales results are slightly worse than the projections of analysts surveyed by FactSet. Wii U sales of 3.45 million units fell short of Nintendo's target of 4 million units in the fiscal year. That already had been lowered from an earlier projection of 5.5 million. Microsoft sends out invites to an Xbox event on May 21. That's when the company will likely reveal its next video game console. — May 1: Activision says the next installment in its successful "Call of Duty" franchise will be titled "Call of Duty: Ghosts" and feature a new story and characters. It will be released Nov. 5 for PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and next-generation consoles.</content>

		<content>Wealth and Politics Converge in China - NYTimes.com Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools WEALTH AND POLITICS CONVERGE IN CHINA  |  The official story in China is that the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, came from humble roots. But his family has had remarkable business success in the years since he came to power, controlling assets worth at least $2.7 billion, according to an investigation by The New York Times. The records uncovered by The Times provide an “unusually detailed look at how politically connected people have profited from being at the intersection of government and business as state influence and private wealth converge in China’s fast-growing economy.” Mr. Wen, The Times report continues, “has broad authority over the major industries where his relatives have made their fortunes.” In one example, Mr. Wen’s relatives made a fortune by investing in Ping An Insurance before its I.P.O. — and after a government body that Mr. Wen presides over exempted the company from certain rules. The holdings were worth as much as $2.2 billion in 2007, according to The Times. This world may be unfamiliar to deal makers on Wall Street, but in emerging markets, political connections offer “the quickest path for riches these days,” wrote Steven M. Davidoff in the Deal Professor column earlier this year. (The Chinese government blocked access to The New York Times online after the article about Mr. Wen’s family was posted.) VIKRAM PANDIT’S FINAL DAYS  |  The coup at Citigroup that toppled Vikram S. Pandit was meticulously planned over the last several months, report Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Susanne Craig in The New York Times. The plan’s author, Michael E. O’Neill, began private meetings with board members since becoming chairman in April, until Mr. Pandit, the chief executive, “had virtually no allies left,” Ms. Silver-Greenberg and Ms. Craig write. This effort was said to culminate in an encounter early last week, when Mr. O’Neill told Mr. Pandit that “the board has lost confidence in you,” prompting Mr. Pandit to resign immediately. He was replaced with Michael L. Corbat, who, The Times report says, was alerted by Mr. O’Neill a few weeks earlier that he might be asked to take the reins. XSTRATA’S GAMESMANSHIP  |  Xstrata has set a date of Nov. 20 for shareholders of the mining company to vote on the merger with the trading house Glencore. As advertised, the structure of the vote allows shareholders to approve the merger while also rejecting $200 million in retention payments. But the reality isn’t so clear-cut, writes Steven M. Davidoff in the Deal Professor column. Xstrata, Mr. Davidoff writes, has set up “a diabolical game of the prisoner’s dilemma.” ON THE AGENDA  |  The chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary L. Schapiro, is speaking about the Dodd-Frank law at George Washington University Law School this morning. K.K.R. announces its quarterly results before the opening bell. Moody’s, Comcast and Merck also report earnings before the market opens. Peter Orszag, Citigroup’s vice chairman of global banking, is on CNBC at 7:30 a.m. Julian Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management, is on Bloomberg TV at 7:30 a.m. Laurence Fink of BlackRock is on CNBC at 8 a.m. The billionaire Kenneth G. Langone is on Bloomberg TV at 4 p.m. An estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product is being released at 8:30 a.m. WALL STREET’S POLITICAL STREAK  |  With the presidential election around the corner, business leaders are engaging in some political activism. A group of more than 80 chief executives, called Fix the Debt, is pushing an agenda that doesn’t fit neatly into either political party, writes Jackie Calmes of The New York Times. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, for example, recently hosted a Wall Street lunch with lawmakers to ask how Republicans could be persuaded to drop their opposition to higher taxes. Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs explained that while these executives are “willing to give more revenue,” they “don’t want to take on the moral hazard” of giving the government more money without a deal to cut the budget, according to Ms. Calmes. For another Wall Street leader, Laurence Fink of BlackRock, the so-called fiscal cliff is a pressing concern. Speaking at a conference hosted by The Economist magazine on Thursday, Mr. Fink lamented that there was “not one question” in the presidential debates about the issue. Of course, it’s not the only topic that’s been absent from the debates. “Remember the euro crisis?” asks Floyd Norris of The New York Times. “In this week’s foreign policy debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, the euro never came up.” If Mr. Romney is elected, he may have a willing Treasury secretary in Glenn Hubbard, his chief economic adviser. Mr. Hubbard, the dean of Columbia University’s business school, “would rather be Treasury secretary than Federal Reserve chairman,” according to Bloomberg News, which cites unidentified people familiar with his thinking.

		<content>Markets Jump on Hopes for European Action - NYTimes.com The beleaguered euro zone remains stuck in recession, according to data published Tuesday, increasing pressure on the European Central Bank to find a way to stimulate growth soon. Stock and bond markets rallied on hopes that the E.C.B. would cut the benchmark interest rate for euro countries as early as next week. On Wall Street, the Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index all closed with gains of more than 1 percent, while the 10-year Treasury bond yield touched 1.645 percent, the lowest intraday level since Dec. 12. Separately, the Dow Jones industrial average skidded more than 150 points briefly in mid-afternoon before recovering after the Twitter account of The Associated Press was hacked and a fake tweet about an attack on the White House was posted. Besides pointing to continued decline in the euro zone economy, the survey of purchasing managers by Markit, a research firm, showed that Germany could be slipping into recession. Germany has served as the main counterweight to economic malaise elsewhere in the euro zone, and a prolonged slowdown could delay a recovery on the whole Continent. The Flash Germany Composite Output index issued by Markit fell to 48.8 in April from 50.6 in March, a six-month low. A reading below 50 is considered a sign that the economy is likely to contract. For the euro zone as a whole, the corresponding index was unchanged at 46.5, confirming that the region remains in a rut. The German economy shrank 0.6 percent in the last three months of 2012. Another negative quarter would push the country into recession and present a problem for Chancellor Angela Merkel as her party campaigns to remain in power in elections this autumn. Meanwhile, the stubborn slowdown in the euro zone is likely to further inflame the debate about how much more austerity troubled countries in Europe can take. Many political leaders are arguing for a greater emphasis on growth. José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said in Brussels on Monday that while countries need to continue cutting government debt and budget deficits, ‘'we need to complement this with proper measures for growth.'’ In Europe’s most troubled countries, there was little sign of a turnaround in growth. Economic activity in Spain declined 0.5 percent in the first three months of this year, the Bank of Spain said in a preliminary estimate Tuesday. Still, markets cheered the pessimistic survey results because of expectations that they would prompt the E.C.B. to cut interest rates or take other action when its policy-making board meets May 2. On Tuesday, the central bank of Hungary, which is not a member of the euro zone, cut its main interest rate to 4.75 percent from 5 percent. It was the bank’s ninth rate cut in as many months. The benchmark French stock market index, the CAC 40, finished the day 3.6 percent higher, while the interest rate on France’s 10-year sovereign bond hit a record low of 1.706 percent. Other major European stock indexes posted gains of more than 2 percent while bond yields fell. For France, the Markit output index rose to 44.2 in April from 41.9 in March, indicating that the pace of decline was slowing in the euro zone’s largest economy after Germany’s. But that tidbit of good news was clouded by a drop in the separate Insee indicator of the French business climate. The decline in optimism among German purchasing managers might be the result of a deceleration in the pace of growth in China, which in recent years has become one of the most important markets for German products like automobiles and machinery. China has helped to compensate for weak demand in the rest of Europe. ‘'The last nine months have been very slow in our business,'’ said Joachim Schönbeck, a member of the management board of SMS Group, a German company that builds and equips factories to produce steel and other metals.</content>

		<content>U.S. Companies Warn of Slowing Sales in Europe - NYTimes.com Barring such a crash, an extended recession in Europe was still likely to hurt the American companies that rely most heavily on Europe for revenue, though it was not clear how many would suffer. Almost three years into this European crisis, there is a surprising amount of uncertainty about exactly how much American companies rely on European sales. Only about half of the companies in the Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index of major American companies break out the portion of their revenue that comes from Europe. “We do not have a clear picture at all,” said Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at Standard and Poor’s. “There is enormous uncertainty.” Tobias Levkovich, chief equity strategist at Citigroup, has estimated that around 11 percent of all revenue earned by companies in the S.and P. 500 index officially comes from Europe. But he said that the actual figure was closer to 15 percent because of unclear reporting and products that first go through other regions. Food and beverage companies, as well as pharmaceutical companies, derive about 22 percent of their revenue from Europe, according to Mr. Levkovich’s analysis. These companies are less likely to be hard hit in case of a deepening recession. “At the end of the day, people in Europe will still buy Pampers even if they cost a drop more,” said Russ Koesterich, the chief investment strategist for the iShares division of BlackRock. The same cannot be said for companies that sell big-ticket products. American automakers could be in particular trouble given that they derive about 27 percent of their sales from Europe, according to Mr. Levkovich. Both Ford and General Motors reported declining sales in Europe in the first quarter, and the problems are being exacerbated by unused factories on the Continent, according to Mike Wall, an analyst at IHS. Industrial companies, which derive 16 percent of sales from Europe, have been slower to report problems, though not in all cases. David Farr, chief executive of the Missouri-based industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric, said in a call with analysts in May that his company’s business on the Continent “has continued to weaken” and that there was “very little recovery in sight.” A few weeks after Cisco’s announcement, Dell’s chief financial officer said the environment in Europe and parts of Asia was “tougher than we had planned.” And a day later, Hewlett-Packard’s chief executive, Meg Whitman, said that her company would face “headwinds” from Europe at least through the end of the year. Some companies facing this situation have taken measures to protect themselves, like withdrawing money from European accounts that would be vulnerable.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com TOP STORIES The Man Behind Facebook’s I.P.O. Debacle  |  It is David Ebersman’s fault, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. There is just no way around it. Mr. Ebersman is Facebook’s well-liked, boyish-looking 41-year-old chief financial officer. He’s not as well known as Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, or Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer and recently appointed director. But when it came to Facebook’s catastrophe of an initial public offering — the stock reached a new low on Friday, closing at $18.06 — it was Mr. Ebersman, not Mr. Zuckerberg or Ms. Sandberg, who was ultimately the one pulling the strings. DealBook »   Multinationals Stake a Claim in Venture Capital  |  New York, London and Hong Kong are common addresses for blue-chip multinationals. Now Silicon Valley is, too. From downtown San Francisco to Palo Alto, companies like American Express and Ford are opening offices and investing millions of dollars in local start-ups. This year, American Express opened a venture capital office in Facebook’s old headquarters in downtown Palo Alto. Less than three miles away, General Motors’ research lab houses full-time investment professionals, recent transplants from Detroit. “American Express is a 162-year-old company, and this is a moment of transformation,” said Harshul Sanghi, a managing partner at American Express Ventures, the venture capital arm of the financial company. “We’re here to be a part of the fabric of innovation.” The companies are raising their profiles in Silicon Valley at a shaky time for the broader venture capital industry. While top players like Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners have grown bigger, most venture capital firms are struggling with anemic returns.

		<content>Places to Sleep Join Forces With Places to Sweat - NYTimes.com Rochelle Jacobs has been working out at Exhale, the mind and body spa, two to three times a week for the last nine years. She says she is so dedicated to her gym that she picks her hotels based on their fitness offerings. “If I’m in a major city where I know there’s an Exhale, I try to stay at that hotel,” said Ms. Jacobs, 39, a beauty industry entrepreneur in Manhattan, who often travels for business. “Usually the hotel gym never looks the way it does on the Web site, but I know what to expect if I go to an Exhale location.” Hotels know that there are many travelers like Ms. Jacobs for whom the gym is often the deciding factor. That can be especially true in a big city, where there are multiple options. Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean at the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, estimated that about 8 percent of travelers picked a hotel based on its fitness offerings. While 8 percent may not sound like a lot, he said, “to a hotel brand, that’s a substantial potential market share.” And though many hotels have perfectly good fitness centers, some hotels see a name-brand gym as a way to distinguish themselves. They have been pairing up with fitness brands like Core Performance, Exhale, DavidBartonGym and SoulCycle in the last few years to offer classes, workouts and nutritional consultations for guests. Other hotels have arrangements with sporting good companies like New Balance (Westin) and Adidas (Fairmont), which provide guests with gear to use during their stay. “Hotels are looking for ways to differentiate themselves, and having a gym in a hotel that’s part of a chain is a way to do that,” said Taylor Hamilton, a senior researcher with IbisWorld, a market research firm. “It’s easy for partnerships, and it gives gyms the feel of a national gym in a national hotel.” Both hotels and fitness companies say the relationship is a win-win. Gyms get the chance to increase their visibility and introduce themselves to potential consumers while saving money. “When you’re co-branding with a hotel company that already has the space, you’re not forking over tons of cash to be there,” said Brett Blumenthal, founder and editor of , a Web site for health-conscious business travelers. “You’re getting the benefit of further exposure and higher brand recognition, but with less financial commitment.” Hotels see the gyms as another source of revenue. Some hotels charge extra fees for gym use. The Gansevoort South Beach, for example, which is home to DavidBartonGym, charges guests $15 for a one-day pass. The Ritz-Carlton Boston Common charges $15 for its adjacent Sports Club/LA, which offers a basketball court, swimming pool and an array of fitness classes. That fee goes directly to the hotel and not the gym, said Smaiyra Million, chief executive of Millennium Partners Sports Club Management, which owns and operates the Sports Club/LA and Reebok Sports Club/NY. Having a professional fitness organization operate the gym also eases any pressure on hotels to try to excel in an unfamiliar arena. As Ms. Million put it: “Some hotels try to operate the gym themselves, and they quickly realize that’s not their core competency. That’s when they say, ‘We need to go and get the experts.’ ” Sheraton Hotels and Resorts turned to Core Performance, a fitness, nutrition and physical therapy company based in Phoenix, to design its gyms and workout routines. Core Performance also designed some menu items in the hotel’s restaurants. Hoyt Harper, global brand leader for Sheraton Hotels and Resorts, in White Plains, said Sheraton hoped to have the program in all 400 Sheraton hotels worldwide by the end of this year. Exhale is also expanding its reach. So far, it operates in eight hotels in the United States, including the Fairmont Battery Wharf in Boston, which opened earlier this year, and the Gansevoort Park Avenue Hotel in New York, where opened last November. “Our database is very valuable to these hotel brands because we end up sharing the same customer,” said Julia Sutton, chief operating officer of Exhale Enterprises. All the hotels offer a full roster of Exhale-designed classes. And even with the $35 fee per class, “We have these Exhale brand loyalists who stay at the hotels because of the class,” she said.</content>

		<content>David Sokol's Other Big Investment - NYTimes.com Article Tools The Warren Buffett Effect is well known. Now, it seems David Sokol can have the same impact on a stock. Shares of the Middleburg Financial Corporation — a small bank in which Mr. Sokol is a large shareholder — were up sharply on Thursday following Mr. Sokol’s resignation from Berkshire Hathaway. Since his abrupt departure, the bank’s stock is up almost 17 percent, increasing its market value to $121 million. The sharp appreciation came amid a swirl of controversy surrounding Mr. Sokol. As part of his surprise announcement on Wednesday, Mr. Buffett disclosed that Mr. Sokol was buying shares of a specialty chemicals company, Lubrizol, at the same time he was orchestrating a deal for Berkshire to buy Lubrizol. Mr. Sokol said he did nothing wrong, and Mr. Buffett has agreed. In a CNBC interview on Thursday morning, Mr. Sokol revealed that he had previously recommended another one of his holdings to Mr. Buffett, describing it as a small bank. He also asserted that “it would never have been of interest to Berkshire.” Mr. Sokol never specifically mentioned what bank he suggested Berkshire should buy. But Mr. Sokol is a major shareholder in Middleburg Financial. He owns 20.2 percent of Middleburg Financial, according to InsiderScore.com, which tracks stock transactions of corporate insiders. In August of 2008, Mr. Sokol disclosed in regulatory filings that he owned 227,000 shares, roughly 5 percent, of Middleburg Financial. He has buying steadily since then, including 400,000 shares that were bought in a private placement in 2010. That deal was valued at $5 million, filings show. Both Middleburg and Mr. Sokol were upfront about Mr. Sokol’s role at Berkshire, often noting his role as chairman at MidAmerican Energy and its connection to Berkshire. Berkshire owns MidAmerican. In one marketing document Middleburg trumpets Mr. Sokol’s investment as an indication that the company is “well capitalized”. Mr. Sokol did not respond to requests for comment. An executive at Middleburg did not return a call for comment.</content>

The American legend had tried a number of turnaround strategies and cost-cutting efforts in recent years, but the company — which since 2004 has reported only one full year of profit — ran short of cash. Article Tools Related Links The Chapter 11 filing Interactive Feature: Kodak's Legacy New York Times: Company Town Avoids Decay (Jan. 16, 2012) “Since 2008, despite Kodak’s best efforts, restructuring costs and recessionary forces have continued to negatively impact the company’s liquidity position, ” Kodak’s chief financial officer, Antoinette P. McCorvey, said in a court filing on Thursday. Citigroup is providing Kodak with $950 million in financing to allow the company to keep going. Kodak plans to continue operating normally during bankruptcy. The company will also seek to continue selling a portfolio of 1,100 digital imaging patents to raise cash for its loss-making operations. Kodak has become the latest giant to falter in the face of advancing technology. The Borders Group liquidated last year after having failed to gain a toehold in e-books, while Blockbuster sold itself to Dish Network last year as its retail outlets lost ground to online competitors like Netflix. Founded in 1880 by George Eastman, Kodak became one of America’s most notable companies, helping establish the market for camera film and then dominating the field. But it has suffered from a variety of problems over the last four decades. First came foreign competitors, notably Fujifilm of Japan, which undercut Kodak’s prices. Then the onset of digital photography eroded demand for traditional film, squeezing Kodak’s business so much that in 2003 the company said that it would halt investing in its longtime product. The Chapter 11 filing was made in United States Bankruptcy Court in Lower Manhattan. Kodak said that its non-American subsidiaries were not part of the filing. The company said that it had about $5.1 billion in assets and nearly $6.8 billion in debts. Its biggest group of unsecured creditors are bondholders represented by the Bank of New York Mellon who are owed $658 million. “Kodak is taking a significant step toward enabling our enterprise to complete its transformation,”  Antonio M. Perez, the company’s chief executive, said in a news release. “At the same time as we have created our digital business, we have also already effectively exited certain traditional operations, closing 13 manufacturing plants and 130 processing labs, and reducing our workforce by 47,000 since 2003. Now we must complete the transformation by further addressing our cost structure and effectively monetizing non-core I.P. assets.” Under Mr. Perez, who joined Kodak from Hewlett-Packard in 2003, the company has bet on inkjet printers. That strategy has yet to bear fruit, however. It has also turned to patent lawsuits to generate revenue, winning settlements from the likes of LG of South Korea. Jonathan Fickies/Bloomberg NewsAntonio M. Perez, chief executive of Kodak. Nonetheless, the company has burned through its cash reserves, stoking concerns that it may run out of money. As of Sept. 30, Kodak reported having $900 million in cash and short-term investments. As a last-ditch effort to raise cash, Kodak announced last July that it had hired Lazard to sell its digital imaging patents, hoping to cash in on a frenzy for intellectual property that drove Google‘s $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility. But the company had failed to garner enough interest among potential buyers, driven in part by fears of Kodak’s deteriorating financial health. But by the fall, it became apparent that Kodak was also preparing for a potential Chapter 11 filing, hiring advisers who could help with a court-supervised restructuring. As reports swirled about Kodak’s preparations for bankruptcy, some of the company’s vendors stopped providing services or demanding quicker payments, the company said in a court filing on Thursday. Besides potentially aiding in the patent sale, bankruptcy protection could also allow Kodak to shed hundreds of millions of dollars in pension obligations. Kodak said in a filing that it contributed about $245 million to its United States pension obligations last year, and that it has been unable to shrink those liabilities to a more manageable level. Earlier this month, Kodak announced a corporate overhaul that split its businesses into consumer and commercial segments, which some analysts said could aid in the sale of parts of the business. The company has also filed new patent infringement suits against a number of competitors, including Fujifilm and Apple Inc., an effort to shore up the value of the patents it hopes to sell. In a court filing, Kodak argued that Apple, the BlackBerry device maker Research in Motion and HTC of Taiwan all owed the company “substantial royalties” for the use of its patents in their smartphones. Reaching licensing agreements with these companies, as Kodak has done with Motorola and LG, could reap Kodak substantial fees. Kodak is  being advised by Lazard, FTI Consulting  and the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell. The company said that Dominic DiNapoli, vice chairman of FTI Consulting, would serve as chief restructuring officer during Chapter 11.

		<content>Prom Spending Is on the Rise Again - NYTimes.com The recession forced parents and teens to cut back on spending for the annual high school dance, but wallets are finally opening again. "Dresses are more elaborate," says Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group. "They are now buying two pairs of shoes, one to go to prom and one to dance in." And so do the parents, who see the dance as a rite of passage. The pressure to help give teenagers a memorable night is high. "You don't want your kid to be the only kid who doesn't have what the other kids have," says Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist and professor at Golden Gate University. Prom spending is expected to rise this spring to an average $1,139. That's among families who are planning to spend some money to attend the annual affair, according to a survey of 1,025 parents of prom age teens by payment processor Visa Inc. and research company Gfk. Not included in the average were 12 percent who said they wouldn't spend anything on the prom. A majority of parents with teenagers surveyed were still unsure how much they'd spend. Leigh Dow didn't have a budget for her 16-year-old daughter's prom dress. She wanted it to be well made, have a good fit and be unique. Dow paid $500 for a raspberry-colored gown with silver beading and a sweetheart neckline. She expects her daughter, Darby McDaniel, who is a junior in high school to wear the dress more than once. Dow will also pay for a hairstylist, a spray tan and part of the cost of a party bus to drive a group of kids to the dance. Mother and daughter bought the dress from a small boutique in Chandler, Ariz., where they live. They chose the boutique because it keeps a registry of the dresses that girls from area schools buy, so that no two girls from the same school show up in identical dresses. "You don't want to be competing with anyone," says McDaniel, whose prom is open to both juniors and seniors. "You don't want to be outshined." Other parents set more precise budgets. Anne Klein, who lives in Durango, Colo., gave her 17-year old daughter a budget of $150 for a prom dress. They picked a $120 peach colored dress from a Macy's Inc. store in San Diego while visiting colleges in the area. The remaining $30 will go towards shoes. David's Bridal, which sells prom dresses, says the average spent on prom dresses this year at its 300 stores is $170. The most popular color is pink blush, thanks to "Hunger Games" actress Jennifer Lawrence, says Brian Beitler, an executive vice president. Lawrence wore a similar color to the Academy Awards. "Kids are fantasizing about their own stardom in a way," says Yarrow. "This is sort of their red carpet moment." Boys want to be noticed too. Men's Wearhouse Inc. says boys are spending anywhere from $60 to $200 on tuxedo rentals. A gray tuxedo by Vera Wang is popular this year. It rents for $180. . The website says that it had to make more of its $220 tuxedos after they sold out three months ago. The retailer, which also sells its tuxedos in small boutiques, attributes the bump in sales to celebrities who have been wearing colored tuxedos to awards shows. Sales of the website's hunting camouflage tuxedos are up 20 percent from a year ago. They're in demand because the cast of popular duck hunting reality show "Duck Dynasty" wear similar ones, says Mark Bietz, vice president of marketing at Wendy Kerschner, of Adamstown, Penn., told her 16-year-old son that she wasn't paying for any of his prom expenses. She wanted to teach him a lesson about spending money. "I am in the minority," says Kerschner, who does marketing for in-home senior care company Comfort Keepers. Her son, Casey Kerschner, paid $129 to rent a gray tuxedo with money he made cleaning stalls at a horse barn. The prom ticket cost the high school junior $50. He spent $20 on two tickets for the after-prom party. He didn't take a limousine earlier this month. Most people in his school didn't. Instead, he paid $10 to get his Volkswagen Jetta cleaned. He's not sure if he will go to the prom again next year. A local tuxedo shop offers high school boys a free rental if they wear a tuxedo all day and hand out fliers and coupons. He might try to do that next year. "The way I see it," he says, "I worked a little over two weeks shoveling stalls at a horse barn to spend five hours at a dance."</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com TOP STORIES Three Major Banks Prepare for Possible Credit Downgrades  |  Some of Wall Street’s biggest banks are bracing for fallout from a possible cut in their credit ratings. Moody’s Investors Service, one of the two big ratings agencies, has said it will decide in mid-May whether to lower its ratings for 17 global financial companies. Morgan Stanley, which was hit hard in the financial crisis, appears to be the most vulnerable. Moody’s is threatening to cut the bank’s ratings by three notches, to a level that would be well below the rating of a rival like JPMorgan Chase. Bank of America and Citigroup may also fall to the same level as Morgan Stanley, but those two are helped by having higher-rated subsidiaries. DealBook » Large Hedge Funds Fared Well in 2011  |  Hedge funds have endured a rough year. Tumultuous markets. Tighter regulations. An insider trading crackdown. But despite the lackluster environment, the top managers still took home $14.4 billion in 2011. Even when returns suffer, the largest hedge funds can collect big paychecks, thanks to the fees they charge pensions, endowments and wealthy individuals to manage money. Paul Tudor Jones II charges a 4 percent management fee and takes 23 percent of any profit. So he made $175 million in 2011, although his main fund tracked the returns of the Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index. Steven A. Cohen, whose firm, SAC Capital Advisors, keeps 50 percent of the profit, earned $585 million. Ray Dalio, the enigmatic founder of Bridgewater Associates, seized the top spot, after his largest fund gained 16.05 percent last year.

		<content>F.D.A. Approves Raptor Drug for Form of Cystinosis - NYTimes.com Reluctant to say it aloud, Natalie Stack wrote her 12th birthday wish on a restaurant napkin: “To have my disease go away forever.” approved a new drug developed with early financing from a foundation that Natalie’s parents established in response to that plea. The drug, which will be sold by the Corporation under the name Procysbi, is for nephropathic cystinosis, an extremely rare inherited disease that, if untreated, typically destroys the kidneys by age 10 and even with a The story behind Procysbi’s development is yet another example of the important role that determined parents and disease foundations can play in supporting drug development, particularly for rare diseases. But Procysbi’s approval could also raise troubling questions about whether society can afford to pay extremely high prices for drugs that treat rare diseases. That is because Procysbi is not a new chemical entity, but rather a more convenient and more tolerable version of an existing drug. The existing drug costs about $8,000 a year, whereas Procysbi will cost $250,000 on average. High prices are typical for drugs to treat so-called orphan diseases. The health care system has tolerated that because, given the small numbers of patients, the overall cost is not that high. But as the orphan drug business model becomes increasingly popular among pharmaceutical companies, the collective cost of the drugs is beginning to mount. will constitute 15.9 percent of spending on prescription drugs by 2018, up from 5.1 percent in 1998. And a survey of 50 insurers and pharmacy benefit managers by J. P. Morgan found that drugs for rare diseases would be one of the areas increasingly subject to scrutiny and possible restrictions on use. and other abdominal problems. Moreover, it must be taken every six hours, which means patients have to get up in the middle of the night, or their parents must wake them. Procysbi has the same ingredient as Cystagon but consists of enteric-coated spheres for delayed release. It can be taken every 12 hours instead of every six. The gastrointestinal side effect, halitosis and body odor, are reduced, though not eliminated, according to the parents of children with the disease. Christopher M. Starr, co-founder and chief executive of Raptor, said he expected it would take time to persuade insurers to bear the extra cost. “I get it,” he said. “It seems trivial when you first look at this.” He said doubters would think: “You’re dying of a disease. Take it every six hours if that is what you need to do.” But Dr. Starr argued that the “subtle advantages” of Procysbi “add up to a significant benefit.” He said as many as 80 percent of patients skip doses of Cystagon, which studies have shown can lead to more rapid deterioration of the kidneys, eyes and other organs. The more tolerable Procysbi should allow people to better take their medicines. Dr. Starr said the price reflected the value of the drug and the need to recoup Raptor’s development costs. The company’s regulatory filings show it has spent $37.4 million on research and development of the cystinosis drug from the company’s inception in 2005 through the end of 2012. Total corporate expenses in that period were $110 million. Procysbi is the first drug approved for Raptor, which is based in Novato, Calif. Analysts expect sales could exceed $100 million annually. Shares of Raptor closed at $6.90 Tuesday, up 5 percent. Procysbi treats a very rare disease. Only about 500 people in the United States, and 3,000 worldwide, are estimated to have cystinosis, according to the F.D.A. The disease is characterized by a buildup in cells of the amino acid cystine. The buildup damages the kidneys and eyes and eventually the thyroid gland, muscles and other organs. Procysbi works by breaking down cystine. Its active ingredient is cysteamine, the same as in Cystagon. Cysteamine was first shown to work in the 1970s by a team led by Dr. Jerry A. Schneider at the University of California, San Diego. The F.D.A. approved Cystagon in 1994.</content>

		<content>For Cohen, Another Big Purchase - NYTimes.com Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools FOR COHEN, ANOTHER BIG PURCHASE  |  Steven A. Cohen has been in a harsh spotlight as he contends with an insider trading investigation into his hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. But that hasn’t stopped the billionaire from going shopping: He reached a deal last week to pay $60 million for an oceanfront property in East Hampton, DealBook’s Peter Lattman reports. At the same time, he has put his duplex apartment on the East Side of Manhattan up for sale, seeking $115 million, Mr. Lattman reports, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The news comes after reports that Mr. Cohen purchased Picasso’s “Le Rêve” for $155 million from the casino owner Stephen A. Wynn. Mr. Cohen’s new Hamptons property, on Further Lane, has an ocean view and is down the road from a home he already owns. (It is unclear whether he is selling that first house.) The $60 million price is among the most expensive real estate sales on Long Island’s South Fork. If Mr. Cohen gets the $115 million asking price for his residence in the Bloomberg Tower, it would be the most expensive sale to date of a Manhattan apartment, Mr. Lattman notes. On Thursday morning, a judge is set to consider the $616 million deal that SAC recently reached with the government to resolve accusations of illegal trading, though Mr. Cohen is not expected to attend the hearing. If that settlement is approved by Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan, the payment will effectively come out of Mr. Cohen’s pocket. CYPRUS BANKS REOPEN  |  Banks in Cyprus are opening on Thursday for the first time in nearly two weeks, but with strict measures limiting withdrawals. “The measures, which are supposed to be in effect for only a week but are widely expected to be extended in some form well into the future, will prohibit electronic transfer of funds from Cyprus to other countries. In addition, individuals will not be allowed to take more than 3,000 euros (about $3,860) in cash outside the country, well below the current ceiling of 10,000 euros,” The New York Times’s Liz Alderman writes. These restrictions are “more reminiscent of Latin America or Africa,” said Bob Lyddon, the managing director of IBOS, an international banking association. Though depositors are set to lose a portion of their savings to help pay for the country’s bailout, Joe Nocera, a columnist for The New York Times, will be shedding few tears. Much of the money held in the Cypriot banking system is Russian, benefiting from lower taxes. “Corrupt officials who embezzle money have long found Cyprus to be a friendly haven,” Mr. Nocera writes. “To put it another way, the henchmen of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, who have gotten rich by trampling over the rule of law, are now getting a taste of their own medicine.” DELL SAID TO BE REIMBURSING BLACKSTONE  |  Dell is picking up the tab for due diligence costs as the Blackstone Group considers making an offer for the company, according to Fortune’s Dan Primack. The private equity firm, which examined Dell’s books as part of a “go-shop” process, “repeatedly requested the concession, threatening to otherwise walk away from the table,” Mr. Primack writes, citing unidentified people close to the situation. The special committee of Dell’s board, obligated to encourage any rival bids to the $24 billion offer from Michael S. Dell and Silver Lake, “eventually favored the move, believing that it would increase the odds of getting a superior offer,” the report says. “If you’re trying to get a higher bid for a $24 billion or $25 billion company, offering up $25 million probably doesn’t seem like too steep a cost,” one unidentified private equity executive not involved in the process told Fortune, by way of explanation.

In addition to representing clients, he will act as an ambassador as the firm looks to grow overseas, Mr. Protess says. “There’s a strong emotional pull to the firm,” Mr. Breuer said. “It’s my professional home.”  |  Contact: @williamalden | E-mail Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.

		<content>A Review of Protective and Waterproof Cases for Smartphones - NYTimes.com AS director of technical operations for CPR, a nationwide chain of cellphone repair shops, Edgar Navarro has seen some epic phone fiascos. Take the cellphone a customer’s cat used as a scratching post (bad kitty!) or the cellphone another customer placed atop sodas in an ice chest to keep it cool (bad condensation!). “I’m not surprised by anything anymore,” said Mr. Navarro, whose company has grown from 10 locations in 2008 to 95 today thanks to the increasing popularity of smartphones and the occasional idiocy of their users. According to manufacturers, insurers and repair shops, the most common reasons for cellphone breakage are tripping while texting, which sends the phone flying, and dropping the cellphone in the toilet. With the cost of replacing a smartphone at several hundred dollars and repairs or data recovery potentially as costly, it might be worth investing in a heavy-duty cellphone case. This is particularly true if you are among the 28 percent of cellphone users perilously “on call” in the bathroom. While some of these cases might look like you wrapped a monster truck tire around your phone, what you sacrifice in appearance you’ll make up in peace of mind. When choosing a protective case; consider its bulkiness, potential for interference with your phone’s functionality, shock and water resistance, charging capability and available accessories like bike mounts and holsters. while you protect your phone. A 1700 mAh battery fits into its polycarbonate, shock-resistant shell so when you put your phone into it, charging begins. The shell is resin-coated so it is strangely soft and easy to grip. For added protection, you can stretch a silicone exterior skin over the sides and back of the shell. For maximum protection, snap a bracketing exoskeleton of polycarbonate over the silicone skin. Even with all that, it’s not excessively bulky, but the battery adds some heft. There is no screen guard but the manufacturer claims encased phones were not damaged after 26 consecutive four-foot drops onto a hardwood floor. The company also makes while protecting it. It has a 2500 mAh battery incorporated into the back of the case so when the battery gives out (after about 500 charging cycles), you have to get a whole new case instead of just a new battery. The case itself is bulky with a polycarbonate shell and substantial rubber exterior but it has a clear plastic screen protector and meets standards developed by the military to withstand rain, dust, sand, shock and drops. Its impenetrability also makes it maddeningly hard to get your phone in and out of the case. has a polycarbonate inner shell that is backed with padding and is fronted with clear plastic to protect your screen. Then you stretch a silicon skin around the sides and back like a slipper. It’s probably the least bulky of the heavy-duty cases on the market and does not impede the phone’s functionality. The manufacturer says it protects against scratches, dust, drops, bumps and shock. But it’s unlikely to save your phone from superserious impacts and certainly not a fall into the toilet. you may own. It has a waffled silicone base skin, a rigid nylon resin snap-on second layer with a clear plastic screen shield. Then it has a big rubber bumper that wraps around the perimeter. The result is something so big it might not fit in your pocket but you get the feeling you could fling it down a flight of concrete steps and your phone would still work just fine — though does not guarantee this. Note: You get a shadow if you take a picture with your phone while the exterior bumper is attached, so you may miss candid shots while you wrestle with your phone to remove it. to be cool and certainly one of the most expensive. It’s somewhat bulky because of its interior truss and suspension system that protects your phone from shock. The design is sort of industrial. Predominately made of polycarbonate, it has silicone bumpers and a silicone back panel as well as shatterproof Gorilla Glass to protect your screen. There’s an anodized, aircraft-grade, aluminum cover for the earphone jack as well as dust- and water-resistant mic and speaker covers. It also comes with a nifty little tool for fastening the teeny-tiny screws that hold the front and back of the case together. But lose the tool or screws and aggravation will undoubtedly ensue. LifeProof, $80 (iPhone 4/4S only); Joy Factory Rain Ballet, $50 (iPhone 4/4S only); and Liquipel, $60 O.K., all you toilet texters, these are the cases for you. They are not just “water resistant” or “rain resistant” like some other cases, they are full-on potty proof. The is billed as waterproof, dustproof and shockproof. It is actually sort of flimsy, so it seems unlikely to save your phone from any significant drops, but it will indeed keep out water. You can also get a range of accessories for it like bike mounts and armbands so you can use it on the go. An article on Thursday about protective cases for cellphones, using information from a news release, misstated the name of one case. It is the Mophie Juice Pack Pro, not the Mophie Juicebox Pro.</content>

		<content>British Group Backs Renegotiating E.U. Role - NYTimes.com ? Or does it crave a looser relationship with Continental allies, one free from meddlesome regulation? The answer to that question remained unclear Monday after a newly formed group of business leaders argued for a renegotiation of Britain’s membership terms — echoing the policy of Prime Minister The new group, called Business for Britain, is intended to counter the intervention of pro-E.U. business leaders who have warned of the dangers of Britain slipping out of the 27-nation bloc and its single market of 500 million people. A statement released Monday to announce the group’s formation was signed by about 500 executives. In the declaration, Business for Britain said Mr. Cameron was “right to seek a new deal for the E.U. and for the United Kingdom’s role in Europe.” Mr. Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum within five years, if he remains in office after elections scheduled for 2015. But that promise has failed to halt the rise of the U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, a small but expanding populist group that wants Britain to quit the Union and curb So far the opposition Labour Party has resisted calls to commit itself to holding a vote on E.U. membership if it wins power in the next general election, though some analysts believe it may ultimately feel the need to do so. Never much attracted to the idea of European unity, the British public tends to see the Union in terms of value for money. That means that the verdict of high-profile business leaders is crucial. In general, big businesses, which depend on international trade, tend to be more pro-European than smaller companies, which are more focused on the domestic market. However, Business for Britain boasts some supporters from larger enterprises, including Karan Bilimoria, founder of Cobra Beer, an international brewing company, and Richard Burrows, chairman of British American Tobacco. “Far from being a threat to our economic interests, a flexible, competitive Europe, with more powers devolved from Brussels, is essential for growth, jobs and access to markets,” the group said in its statement. Like Mr. Cameron, Business for Britain has yet to identify what powers London should seek to win back from the Union, though it says it intends to answer that question later this year. And also like Mr. Cameron, Business for Britain has not said whether it would recommend leaving the Union if negotiations on new membership terms do not lead to significant change. In January pro-European business leaders including Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, and Roger Carr, president of the Confederation of British Industry, a lobbying group, signed a letter that warned against risking Britain’s membership in the European Union. A group of more skeptical business leaders countered with a letter supporting Mr. Cameron’s approach. “Everyone wants reform in Europe but without throwing away the advantages we get from permanent full access to Europe’s single market and maximizing British influence in it,” “This new group of familiar names and small businesses may hinder this process and slide towards UKIP’s rather than David Cameron’s position,” Mr. Mandelson continued. “My fear is that this will not help to advance Mr. Cameron’s cause in Europe.” Leaders on both sides of the issue argue that the Union needs to reform. Pro-Europeans have begun to rally behind two different campaign groups. One, Business for New Europe, has sought to argue the case that Britain must engage strongly with the European Union in order to bring about any significant reforms. Another organization, called British Influence, describes itself as an independent advocacy campaign that wants Britain to lead in Europe.</content>

		<content>Many Banks Are Clinging to Billions in Bailout Money - NYTimes.com Minh Uong/The New York Times Even as the nation’s biggest banks stepped further out of the government’s shadow on Friday, hundreds of financial institutions were still hanging on to billions of taxpayers’ dollars. Nearly 600 institutions, ranging from large regional powerhouses to small community banks, are holding on to more than $30 billion — about 13 percent of the $245 billion handed out to banks at the height of the financial crisis. Some of the money will be paid back quickly. Two of the largest remaining bailout recipients, SunTrust and KeyCorp, swiftly announced plans to return their bailout funds, after getting a clean bill of health from the Federal Reserve on Friday. But others will be slower to part with their federal money. A number of institutions like Synovus Financial and Regions Financial are struggling to return to profitability. Relatively healthy banks like MandT Bank and MB Financial are holding on to their emergency cash, while using the money to acquire other banks, make more loans and buy investments for their portfolios. Article Tools The rest of the bailout cash is scattered among community banks across the country. Many small lenders remain dependent on the low-cost capital. Dozens more like Security Business Bank of San Diego are simply swapping their federal rescue money for potentially cheaper financing from the same source: the government. The situation underscores how difficult it is for the government to extricate itself from the financial system and the broader economy. At the height of the financial crisis, the government opened its coffers, injecting much needed capital into the banking industry through the highly contentious Troubled Asset Relief Program. Wall Street titans, eager to shed the stigma and restrictions on executive compensation, quickly repaid the TARP money. A few smaller institutions did the same this month, putting the bank bailout program within a few dollars of breaking even. The New York Times The Treasury Department now estimates that it will turn a $12 billion profit on the initial bank bailout, mainly from its investment in Citigroup. “This program helped to support the nation’s small, medium and large banks during an unprecedented financial crisis,” said David Miller, the Treasury’s chief investment officer. “Since then, the markets have begun to stabilize, and we now estimate that taxpayers will see a healthy return on their investment.” The government plans to earn $20 billion from all of its emergency investments in the banking industry. But its ultimate gain will depend on the 600 or so banks that are sitting on taxpayer dollars. Some banks desperately need the money. More than 140 banks have missed their recent dividend payments to the government, according to an analysis by Linus Wilson, professor of finance at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The financial institutions — including Bank of Blue Valley in Overland Park, Kan., and Anchor Bank in Madison, Wis. — risk defaulting on their federal debt, said Professor Wilson. The group collectively owes the government about $4 billion. Mark A. Fortino, Blue Valley’s chief financial officer, said his bank had enough capital to catch up on its dividend payments. The bank, however, may hold on to its original bailout funds for up to three years, Mr. Fortino said. “Frankly, a 5 percent dividend is very attractive financing,” Mr. Fortino said. “It’s given us the cushion to be an active lender.” Anchor Bank did not returns calls asking for comment. Other banks like Synovus Financial are current on their payments, but bleeding money. Synovus, based in Columbus, Ga., owes the United States nearly $1 billion and recently posted its 10th consecutive quarterly loss. It also faces civil lawsuits stemming from soured investments in luxury resorts. “The repayment of TARP is not their greatest concern at this point,” said Brett Scheiner, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. “The main thing they care about is reducing their troubled loan balances.” Synovus did not return calls seeking comment. For banks in similarly weak positions, the only way to get off the government dole may be to find a deep-pocketed buyer. In December, Marshall and Isley, which owes the government $1.7 billion, agreed to a takeover by the BMO Financial Group of Canada. BMO plans to pay off the TARP cash before the deal closes. The Whitney Holding Corporation, the oldest bank in New Orleans, agreed in December to merge with the profitable and healthy Hancock Holding Corporation. Hancock expects to repay Whitney’s $300 million in bailout funds, too. “TARP is a driver of mergers,” said Christopher McGratty, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. “The solution is: Why not sell and let them pay it off for me?” Dozens of other small banks are looking to the government to help them repay their bailout funds because many are finding it difficult to raise money in the capital markets Under a new program designed to spur small business lending, community banks can exchange their rescue money for a potentially cheaper capital. So far, about 400 small banks have applied for $6 billion through the program, with about half planning to repay their bailout. Institutions that take advantage of the program can cut their government borrowing costs from 5 percent to as low as 1 percent, if they meet certain lending targets. Paul Rodeno, chief executive of Security Business Bank of San Diego, calls the program a “breath of fresh air” since he will immediately lower his interest payments — and use fresh money to pay back the bank’s $5.8 million bailout. Even so, it’s hard to shake the “son of TARP” or “TARP Jr.” moniker that some Republicans initially gave the program. After all, banks are simply trading one form of federal aid for another. While bigger banks have better access to capital, some are reluctant to repay the government, even though they are in decent financial shape. “There are definitely banks healthy enough to repay,” said Jim Sinegal, an analyst at research firm Morningstar. “Some of the more high-quality banks should be ready and willing to repay. It’s clearly a management decision at this point.” Some banks worry that issuing new stock would hurt existing investors. The banks would prefer to delay offerings for months, in the hopes their stock prices will be higher. “They see tomorrow as a better day,” said Mr. Scheiner of FBR. Meanwhile, banks are using the emergency funds to finance long-term operations. In November, MandT, which owes taxpayers $750 million, bought another bailout recipient Wilmington Trust, for $351 million. At the time, MandT said it was aiming to repay TARP funds “at some point in the near future.” The bank turned a $736 million profit last year. Citizens Republic Bancorp in Flint, Mich., which has $300 million in bailout capital, used the money to make more loans and buy mortgage-backed securities, according to government records. But politicians and federal officials want healthy banks to follow the lead of SunTrust and KeyCorp, rather than worrying about the stock price or other issues. “It’s a better deal for the shareholders, not the taxpayer,” said Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the House oversight committee’s bailout panel. “Any institution that’s financially stable should pay back taxpayers as soon as possible.”</content>

		<content>China Woos Overseas Companies, Looking for Deals - NYTimes.com Stephen McGee for The New York TimesWorkers at A123 Systems, a bankrupt Michigan battery maker that a Chinese group recently bought most of for $256 million. HONG KONG — Even as Wall Street deal makers await a revival of the moribund merger market, Chinese companies are shopping abroad with their wallets out. Yet they are also facing scrutiny, particularly in Washington, as Chinese corporate buying trips coincide with a growing assertiveness in Chinese foreign policy, including the deployment in recent months of surveillance vessels and even naval destroyers and frigates in a series of territorial confrontations with American allies like Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. So far this year, the dollar volume of Chinese acquisitions overseas is up 28 percent from the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with a 2.8 percent slump in global merger and acquisition volume over all. Article Tools Related Links Graphic: Government-Backed Buyers Chinese international acquisitions are ahead for the year despite a slump during the third quarter, as state-owned enterprises, which are the main Chinese buyers, and some private enterprises waited for a change in the country’s political leadership at the Communist Party Congress in mid-November. But now the Chinese buyers are back. Two deals by Chinese companies were announced this week, and bankers and lawyers say that discussions are starting or are already under way on numerous other transactions. Many of those, however, may take as long as a year to complete given China’s bureaucratic approval processes. “You will see an acceleration — you see it now,” although it would not amount to an immediate flood of transactions, said André Loesekrug-Pietri, the chairman and managing partner of A Capital, a Hong Kong-based private equity fund. Dave Olecko/Nexen, via European Pressphoto AgencyAn oil drilling site belonging to Nexen, a Canadian company that is the subject of a takeover bid from the Chinese group Cnooc. Indeed, Beijing is pushing for additional deals, and has encouraged the state-controlled banking sector to finance them. “An increase in overseas investment by Chinese companies is an inevitable trend,” the commerce minister, Chen Deming, said at a conference two weeks ago, adding that China did not want to remain overwhelmingly invested in fixed-income securities. “With foreign reserves of $3 trillion in hand,” he added, “we will not sit back and watch the assets depreciate with the third round of quantitative easing. We must inject it into the real economy and make our contribution to global prosperity.” Wanxiang Group agreed on Sunday to pay $256 million to buy most of A123 Systems, a bankrupt manufacturer of high-tech batteries. And a consortium of Chinese investors agreed on the same day to pay $4.2 billion for a controlling stake in the American International Group’s aircraft leasing business. On Friday, Canada approved the $15 billion acquisition of Nexen, an energy company, by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc. That deal is still pending approval by the American committee that reviews foreign investments on national security grounds, commonly known as Cfius. A few deals may be completed this winter, but the real surge is likely to happen by next summer, bankers and lawyers said. State-owned enterprises account for as much as four-fifths of China’s overseas acquisitions by value and many of their top executives are expected to change jobs this winter as the country’s new leaders start promoting their followers. While the Communist Party Congress in November produced a new Politburo, a new slate of government ministers and vice premiers must still be selected at the National People’s Congress in March, a process that could also slow down deals. Chinese regulations further require that at least three different agencies approve each overseas acquisition — the Ministry of Commerce, the National Development and Reform Commission and the State Administration of Exchange Control. The assent of a fourth, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, is needed to qualify for extra financing and faster approval in certain sectors deemed strategic, like clean energy, said Mao Tong, a partner at the law firm Squire Sanders. But despite the long lead time for Chinese deals, bankers say the process is clearly starting. Two of the biggest deals by Chinese companies this year were for control of North American companies. The bid for the A.I.G. business, the International Lease Finance Corporation, or I.L.F.C., is the biggest takeover by Chinese entities on record, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The roots of that transaction were planted last fall. Members of China’s new government wanted to show the country’s seriousness in pursuing investments outside of China, and spent time assembling the most fitting consortium to pursue a deal for the business. The government chose as the face of the deal Weng Xianding, a veteran of China’s financial regulatory agencies who has turned to investing. His company, New China Trust, is essentially a major Chinese commercial lender, counting Western firms like Barclays among its investors. Once the preferred consortium was formed around September, it began talking with A.I.G., with many of the details being negotiated between Mr. Weng and the American insurer’s chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche. A goal for the Chinese, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, was to conduct the talks in a “Western way,” using Western advisers and not getting bogged down in traditional bureaucratic mire. The talks were completed in just over three months, and the buyers successfully negotiated a discount of nearly half of I.L.F.C.’s book value. Two evolving trends are apparent in Chinese international deal making, Chinese government officials, bankers, lawyers and trade experts said in interviews. The government is putting heavy pressure on Chinese companies to seek minority stakes, and not to automatically seek full control, so as to tap foreign management expertise, two officials said. At the same time, Chinese companies are broadening their range of acquisition targets to include more industrial manufacturers and consumer brand companies, even as they maintain their interest in natural resources and financial services. “I wouldn’t say there’s a desire to buy minority stakes, but I think there’s a greater acceptance that’s an appropriate thing to do,” said Michael S. Weiss, the head of China mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley. Other bankers said that one big obstacle to the purchase of minority stakes lay in the wariness of many foreign companies in accepting a Chinese partner — particularly since nearly four-fifths of Chinese acquirers are state-owned enterprises, and most of the rest tend to have Chinese government links. Many of today’s buyers have drawn lessons from past failures and moved to assuage government regulators before striking deals. Cnooc, in particular, learned from its failed bid to buy the oil company Unocal seven years ago, and tried to apply those lessons in its pursuit of Nexen. The Chinese company considered the deal in part because it believed that a takeover could win approval, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. While a big player in Canada’s energy community, Nexen was not one of the country’s iconic companies, heading off the sort of brutal fight that surrounded a takeover battle for Potash, the producer of an important fertilizing ingredient. Cnooc hired an army of advisers, including lobbyists and public relations specialists, to press the point that a deal would only strengthen the Canadian energy company. And Cnooc was open about much of its financing, aiming to halt concerns that it was being financed cheaply by state-run banks. Still, national security concerns could also slow some deals. Bankers and lawyers say that Cfius, which stands for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, can sometimes prove frustrating to would-be buyers. The group scrutinizes deals to ensure that they do not harm the country’s national security interests. Unlike the process in Canada, where negotiations with the foreign investment watchdog are public, the Cfius review takes place largely behind closed doors, and buyers are not always told why deals are rejected. A Treasury spokeswoman, Natalie Earnest, said in a statement: “As we consider foreign investments in the United States, of course, we have an obligation — like any country — to protect our national security, and that is the exclusive focus of Cfius.” Michael R. Wessel, a Democratic appointee to the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said that bipartisan concern was growing in Congress about the first of the Chinese deals to be announced this autumn, a $117.6 million acquisition of Complete Genomics, a company in Mountain View, Calif., that does DNA sequencing. Mr. Wessel, who also advises the United Steelworkers union on trade issues, was also critical of the A.I.G. deal. He said that the Chinese government could pressure airlines to buy Chinese-made parts for their leases, and could eventually urge airlines to lease Chinese-made civilian airliners now being developed. A spokesman for the buyers’ group said in a statement that I.L.F.C. already had one of the largest aircraft order books in aviation, with a commitment to purchase up to 279 Boeing and Airbus aircraft between now and 2020. “We will continue to add to this order book as we see opportunities in the marketplace based on the market appeal of the aircraft and the economics offered by the manufacturers,” he added. Some would-be Chinese buyers have not fully considered how much work is needed to ensure that their investments will go through, advisers say. “I think many Chinese companies in particular have not taken into account the need to be in touch with Washington policy makers about their needs,” said Nancy L. McLernon, the chief executive of the Organization for International Investment, a group that represents domestic subsidiaries of foreign companies. “Those who do, fare best.” Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong, and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.

		<content>Apple Unlocks More Cash for Investors as Profit Slides - NYTimes.com SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday bowed to investors' demands to share more of its $145 billion cash pile, while posting its first quarterly profit decline in more than a decade. The new expanded capital plan includes issuing debt for the first time to fund $100 billion in share repurchases and higher dividends until the end of 2015. That doubles the amount from a program set up last year and makes Apple the largest dividend-paying company in the world. The company's shares, which last week closed below $400 for the first time since December 2011, rose briefly. But they retreated after Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts on a conference call that "some really great stuff" was coming in the fall and 2014. That suggested Apple would have no new products in the market for the next few months. Apple relies heavily on new product launches to drive revenue growth. It recently refreshed its offerings in October, unveiling the 7.9-inch iPad mini and an updated full-size iPad. The new capital plan came as Apple's fiscal second quarter profit slid 18 percent. While revenue rose 11 percent, it slowed sharply from 2012 and previous years. Cook also acknowledged that Apple's once stratospheric growth had tempered but stressed that the company's position remained strong. "Though we've achieved a credible scale and financial success, we acknowledge that our growth rate has slowed and our margins have decreased from the exceptionally high level we experienced in 2012," he said, in an unusually frank admission of the company's less upbeat circumstances. In the last couple of years, demand for Apple's iPhones and iPads has tended to ebb ahead of expected launches, which analysts said would hurt its profit for the current quarter. Apple is forecasting revenue of $33.5 billion to $35.5 billion this quarter, lagging Wall Street's average projection of $38.2 billion. Once considered a near sure-fire bet by Wall Street, worries about slowing growth and narrowing margins have made Apple's shares among the worst performers this year. Since hitting a record close of $702.10 last September, the world's largest technology company has shed 44 percent, losing more than $280 billion of market value - or more than the entire market capitalization of Google Inc. While Apple is still growing, its pace of growth has slowed as high-end smartphone adoption approaches saturation in the developed world and it goes head-to-head with increasingly aggressive rivals in developing countries such as China and India where cheaper models are more popular. It sold a better-than-expected 37.4 million iPhones in the March quarter, and 19.5 million iPads. But that was after many analysts had lowered their forecasts over the past month, responding to reports of delays in shipments and production, as well as decelerating consumer demand. In the Greater China region, which Cook again stressed on Tuesday was a market with massive potential, Apple chalked up 8 percent revenue growth to $8.2 billion - the second slowest expansion of any region reported, after the United States. The collapse of Apple's stock price has incensed investors, spurring many, including Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, to call on the company publicly to dole out more of its cash directly to shareholders. The tech giant's expanded plan unveiled on Tuesday marks a $55 billion increase to a program unveiled just a year ago. "This positive development represents a more shareholder friendly capital allocation policy and demonstrates the conviction of Apple's management and board in the company's future," Greenlight said in a statement late on Tuesday. Apple earned $9.5 billion or $10.09 a share in the quarter, down from $11.6 billion or $12.30 a year earlier. The company reported better-than-expected second-quarter revenue of $43.6 billion, beating Wall Street's average forecast for $42.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, as iPhone and iPad sales surpassed investors' lowered expectations. But Wall Street zeroed in on Apple's industry-leading margins, which it fears are under pressure as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and other Google Android software adopters flood the market with lower-priced models. Gross margins came in at 37.5 percent in the second quarter, while expectations were for 38.5 percent. Apple's shareholders will now get an annual dividend of $12.20 per share, making Apple one of the highest dividend-paying companies. With about 940 million shares outstanding, Apple will return $11.5 billion to shareholders over 12 months, an amount that exceeds the market value of 200 other corporations in the SandP 500. In a rare move, the company also said it plans to raise debt for the expanded program but did not provide any details. Investors have urged the company to borrow rather than repatriate money from abroad, where much of its cash is parked, to avoid incurring heavy taxes. Some investors cling to the hope that Apple will come up with a revolutionary product again this year, with speculation ranging from a "smart-watch" to some form of television format that can up-end the industry. "It's a transitional quarter," said Destination Wealth Management's Michael Yoshikami. "The new products are all coming out next quarter and China still hasn't kicked in." "Given the fact that the whisper was for them to not even hit the lower number (on revenue), given the fact that they hit the midpoint numbers, this slight beat is actually very positive."

		<content>New Technologies Redraw the World’s Energy Picture - NYTimes.com China is also moving fast. With a goal of satisfying 10 percent of its gas demand from shale by 2020, it held its first shale gas auction in June. China has a big incentive to develop shale gas, because it is poised to become the world’s largest importer of natural gas and it wants to reduce its dependence on coal to clean up the air of its cities. In the last five years, as engineers advanced their techniques, shales have begun to produce oil as well. The Bakken field in North Dakota and Montana now produces 400,000 barrels a day, up from a trickle in 2007, and oil executives predict production could soar to a million barrels a day by 2015. The first well was drilled in the Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas three years ago; the field now produces more than 100,000 barrels a day, with 420,000 expected by 2015. There are 20 other shale and similar tight rock fields across the United States that could make states like Ohio and Michigan major producers. Exploration of such fields outside the United States and Canada is barely in its infancy, although there are major shale fields across Europe, China, Australia, Africa and South America. “It could change production forecasts around the world,” said Bobby Ryan, Chevron’s vice president for global exploration. “But we are still at the point of the spear. We have to shoot the seismic first to find out.” Chinese, Norwegian and other foreign companies have already entered into joint ventures in shale oil and gas exploration in the United States to learn fracking techniques. China is moving fast to study its shales, although so far there seems to be more gas than oil. Argentina also looks promising for oil and gas, with American companies including Apache, Exxon Mobil and EOG Resources making large investments in shale in the Argentine province of Neuquen. But there are constraints, including political opposition. Geological analysis of shales globally has barely started, and there are limits to the equipment and skilled manpower available for drilling. This has delayed fracturing jobs and raised costs in developed fields. Africa and the Middle East appear to have promising reserves, and Saudi Arabia has begun studying its shale fields, but the water requirements for fracking will be a high hurdle absent a technological breakthrough. The last frontier, at least for the foreseeable future, is the high Arctic, most of which is still unexplored by oil companies. High winds, months of darkness and icebergs have long stymied dreams of finding vast quantities of oil and gas in the northern reaches of the globe. A 2008 assessment by the United States Geological Survey estimated that a quarter of the world’s remaining undiscovered conventional oil and gas is in the Arctic, more than 80 percent of it in forbidding offshore areas. Again the United States is the big potential winner, with an estimated one-third of the total undiscovered oil, according to the survey. Large oil and gas discoveries began in Russia and Alaska in the 1960s, and more than 40 fields are now in production across Alaska, Russia, Norway and Canada. Shell has been trying for five years to drill in Alaska’s Chukchi and Beaufort Seas and has invested about $4 billion on 10-year leases. But regulatory agencies or courts have delayed its efforts, because of concerns that Arctic waters are vital breeding grounds for many aquatic species that are endangered or at risk and that a well blowout could cause a huge leak that would be difficult or impossible to fix. A paper released by the national commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon spill warned that a serious leak in the high Arctic would be extremely difficult to clean up. That is partly because skimmers can become clogged in ice and spilled oil is unlikely to degrade in frigid temperatures. But in August, Shell received conditional approval from the Interior Department to begin drilling exploratory wells next summer. The company estimates that 25 billion barrels of oil are in the Alaskan Arctic, mostly in the Chukchi Sea.</content>

		<content>Flagstar to Pay $110 Million to Settle MBIA Mortgage Lawsuit - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (Reuters) - Flagstar Bancorp Inc said Thursday it would pay $110 million to settle a lawsuit by MBIA Inc accusing the bank of misrepresenting the quality of loans underlying $1.1 billion in mortgage-backed securities. MBIA filed the lawsuit in January in the latest legal spat between bond insurers and banks that packaged mortgage financial products at the center of the 2008 financial crisis. "Today's announcement represents another major milestone in putting legacy challenges behind us," Flagstar CEO Michael Tierney said in a statement. MBIA, based in Armonk, New York, in the lawsuit said it had agreed to insure two mortgage-backed transactions by Flagstar in 2006 and 2007. But mortgage defaults mounted, resulting in MBIA paying out $165 million, the lawsuit said. MBIA CEO Jay Brown in a statement said the settlement amount was "consistent with our recovery expectations." The settlement has no impact on a separate lawsuit filed in 2011 by another bond insurer, Assured Guaranty Ltd, which following a trial won a $106.5 million judgment against the Troy, Michigan-based lender. Flagstar is appealing against that decision, which came out of the first trial in the bond insurers' lawsuits against the banks. MBIA's case had been assigned to the same judge, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan. MBIA said Thursday that Flagstar would pay the settlement to its structured finance insurer MBIA Insurance Corporation. The amount of the loan outstanding at the time of the settlement was $1.7 billion, MBIA said on February 27 in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The loan was secured in part by any future receivables MBIA expected in pursuing claims against banks over mortgage-backed securities. MBIA has cases still pending against other banks, including Countrywide Financial Corp, which Bank of America Corp bought in 2008. The case is MBIA Insurance Corporation v. Flagstar ABS, LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, 13-0262.</content>

		<content>As Boom Lures App Creators, Tough Part Is Making a Living - NYTimes.com ROSEDALE, Md. — Shawn and Stephanie Grimes spent much of the last two years pursuing their dream of doing research and development for But they did not actually have jobs at Apple. It was freelance work that came with nothing in the way of a regular income, health insurance or retirement plan. Instead, the Grimeses tried to prepare by willingly, even eagerly, throwing overboard just about everything they could. They sold one of their cars, gave some possessions to relatives and sold others in a yard sale, rented out their six-bedroom house and stayed with family for a while. They even cashed in Mr. Grimes’s 401(k). The couple’s chosen field is so new it did not even exist a few years ago: writing software applications for mobile devices like the . Even as unemployment remained stubbornly high and the economy struggled to emerge from the recession’s shadow, the ranks of computer software engineers, including app writers, increased nearly 8 percent in 2010 to more than a million, according to the latest available government data for that category. These software engineers now outnumber farmers and have almost caught up with lawyers. Much as the Web set off the dot-com boom 15 years ago, apps have inspired a new class of entrepreneurs. These innovators have turned cellphones and tablets into tools for discovering, organizing and controlling the world, spawning a multibillion-dollar industry virtually overnight. The iPhone and iPad have about 700,000 apps, from Instagram to Angry Birds. Yet with the American economy yielding few good opportunities in recent years, there is debate about how real, and lasting, the rise in app employment might be. Despite the rumors of hordes of hip programmers starting million-dollar businesses from their kitchen tables, only a small minority of developers actually make a living by creating their own apps, according to surveys and experts. The Grimeses began their venture with high hopes, but their apps, most of them for toddlers, did not come quickly enough or sell fast enough. And programming is not a skill that just anyone can learn. While people already employed in tech jobs have added app writing to their résumés, the profession offers few options to most unemployed, underemployed and discouraged workers. One success story is Ethan Nicholas, who earned more than $1 million in 2009 after writing a game for the iPhone. But he says the app writing world has experienced tectonic shifts since then. “Can someone drop everything and start writing apps? Sure,” said Mr. Nicholas, 34, who quit his job to write apps after iShoot, an artillery game, became a sensation. “Can they start writing good apps? Not often, no. I got lucky with iShoot, because back then a decent app could still be successful. But competition is fierce nowadays, and decent isn’t good enough.” The boom in apps comes as economists are debating the changing nature of work, which technology is reshaping at an accelerating speed. The upheaval, in some ways echoing the mechanization of agriculture a century ago, began its latest turbulent phase with the migration of tech manufacturing to places like China. Now service and even white-collar jobs, like file clerks and data entry specialists or office support staff and mechanical drafters, are disappearing. “Technology is always destroying jobs and always creating jobs, but in recent years the destruction has been happening faster than the creation,” said Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist and director of the M.I.T. Center for Digital Business. Still, the digital transition is creating enormous wealth and opportunity. Four of the most valuable American companies — Apple, Google, Microsoft and I.B.M. — are rooted in technology. And it was Apple, more than any other company, that set off the app revolution with the iPhone and iPad. Since Apple unleashed the world’s freelance coders to build applications four years ago, it has paid them more than $6.5 billion in royalties.</content>

		<content>Four A’s Conference Vows to Appeal to Its Dual Constituencies - NYTimes.com HERE is a look at some highlights, lowlights and sidelights of the annual Transformation conference of the — one for media agencies, that dated to the mid-1990s, and one for everyone else, dating to 1917 — into a single event. Since then, the organization has tried to draw up agendas that would appeal to all attendees. Last year, many media agency executives complained there was not enough content for them, while many of their counterparts in the management and creative realms said there were too many media-related sessions. This year, the agenda was divided by subjects, with the first general session devoted to creativity and management, the second to media and the third to a mélange that favored media. That went over like a cigarette commercial at a conference of the American Cancer Society. “We haven’t seen a lot of transformation at this conference,” said the moderator of the final panel, Steven Wolfe Pereira, executive vice president at the MediaVest division of the Starcom MediaVest Group, part of the Publicis Groupe, and managing director of its MV42 unit. Nancy Hill, president and chief executive of the Four A’s, acknowledged the conference might need additional transformation. Next year, she promised, Mr. Pereira’s panel of rising media stars “will be the first panel on the first day of the conference” rather than the last on the last day. Chris Weil, the chairman of the Four A’s who is also the chief executive of the Momentum Worldwide division of the McCann Worldgroup, said: “We want to make this better every year.” He and Ms. Hill also pledged that unlike this year, the 2014 conference would not overlap with the The organizers of the conference sought to weave its location into the agenda. For instance, the first general session was opened by Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, who informed “those of you without spatial awareness” that the Hyatt Regency hotel that hosted the conference was “the building that was blown out by Katrina.” That session also featured a lively conversation with James Carville and Mary Matalin, who were married in New Orleans and now live there. Each general session, meal and reception featured musicians like the Pinettes Brass Band, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, the Roots of Music Marching Crusaders and Irma Thomas, the “Soul Queen of New Orleans.” And bottles of hot sauce were omnipresent on the buffet tables at all the breakfasts and lunches. of the Association of National Advertisers than at the Four A’s events. This time, the agency executives rivaled their clients. Examples included “bounce rate,” “conversation across multiple entry points,” “cross-channel buying experience,” “cross-functional breakthrough teams,” “customer decision journey,” “ecosystem playing field” and “zetabytes.” There were also “news release,” used as a verb; “return on engagement,” as opposed to return on investment; and “stability agents,” in counterpoint to change agents. One speaker acknowledged a potential effect of glib trade talk. “We sometimes hide behind a veil of impenetrable jargon,” said Laura Simpson, global director for the McCann Truth Central unit of the McCann Worldgroup, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, who gave a presentation on consumer perceptions about the industry. For decades, speakers at the Four A’s conferences carefully kept their remarks G-rated, perhaps reflecting the commissions they collected from what a character in the movie “A Letter to Three Wives” called “the most respected trademarks in the American home.” During this conference, several speakers, seemingly inspired by the relaxed atmosphere of New Orleans, were more frank. There were multiple uses of four-letter words, as well as what can be called, in a family newspaper, a barnyard epithet. Perhaps the most spirited panel of the conference was composed of senior executives from six media agency giants. “We haven’t seen the heads of the six families gathered together since ‘The Godfather,’ ” said the moderator, David Verklin, operating partner at Calera Capital and a former head of one family, Aegis Media Americas, part of the Aegis Group. Mr. Verklin is the kind of movie fan who knows there were five mob families in “The Godfather” but would not let a factoid stand in the way of a joke. A lively panel composed of four senior executives in television ad sales talked up the value of sports programming because viewers almost always watch it live. Jo Ann Ross, president for network sales at the CBS Television Network unit of the CBS Corporation, described how she and David Levy, president for sales, distribution and sports at the Turner Broadcasting System division of Time Warner, “are in business together” through 2024, sharing rights to the men’s basketball tournament of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. , “I was the only one who went to church.” The moderator, Abbey Klaassen, editor of Advertising Age, replied, “I’m not sure David Levy would go to church.”</content>

		<content>Media Companies Hold ‘Upfront’ Advertiser Events Early - NYTimes.com THE calendar says early March, but efforts by major media companies to attract advertising dollars, once reserved for the spring, are already in full swing. How busy is it? In Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, there were three such events to woo marketers and agencies, held one after the other at breakfast time, lunchtime and in the early afternoon, with the final one wrapped up in time for happy hour. These efforts by media companies are known on Madison Avenue as upfronts, because they take place before the coming television season. For decades, when there was only broadcast television, the upfront presentations were scheduled for mid-May. In the last few years, in response to the proliferation of cable, video, online viewing and social media, events have been added earlier in the spring, with fanciful titles like Now, however, media giants like Google, NBCUniversal, Time Warner and Viacom are front-running the upfronts. The winter has been filled with events hosted by cable channels like and the Warner Brothers Brand Networks unit of Time Warner, which sells commercial time in programs like “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” and a newcomer, “Bethenny,” scheduled for the fall. “Every single day of the year, you can be at an upfront, an ‘infront’ or a ‘newfront,’ ” said Wenda Harris Millard, president at MediaLink, laughing. There is a simple reason for the decision to pull the upfront forward: if money can be had and deals booked, why wait? “Any head start to help our clients understand what we’re doing helps us,” said Lauren Hogan, senior director for the Southeast at USA Today, on Tuesday morning at the first-ever upfront presentation by USA Today’s parent, the The event, which the company called Gannett Front, was promoted on Twitter with the hashtag #GannettConnects. About 400 people came to the AXA Equitable building for breakfast and a slick, hourlong presentation styled like a television show, complete with a singer, a standup comedian who played host, speakers billed as guests and filmed skits described as commercials. The Gannett upfront pitch was to consider the company not just as a newspaper publisher but also as an information provider with strength in newer realms like mobile, online video and social media. Or, as Mary Murcko, president for national sales at Gannett, put it, “Gannett is more than you thought.” In introducing her, the comedian, Andrew Kennedy, said: “This is the sales and presentation part of the presentation. How’s that for being upfront?” The next event, at the Times Center, included a four-song set by the singer Sheryl Crow and a look at an ambitious development slate at the CMT cable channel, part of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. CMT plans its first animated series, “Bounty Hunters,” with voices by comedians like Jeff Foxworthy; news and documentary programs; a reality series, “Dog and Beth: On the Hunt,” featuring the bounty hunter Dog Chapman and his wife; and a pranks show, “Hillbillies for Hire.” The goal, said Jayson Dinsmore, executive vice president for development at CMT, is to expand the channel’s current two nights a week of original programming to three by January 2014 and four by 2016. As for presenting two and a half months before the broadcast networks host their upfronts, Brian Philips, president at CMT, said: “We know everyone’s busy. We want to be in people’s consciousness early. And we have a lot going on now; we want to capture the moment.” The final presentation was by the Fox Sports Media Group, part of News Corporation, which used the occasion , after considerable speculation, that it would convert its Speed cable channel, effective on Aug. 17, into a national competitor to ESPN called Fox Sports 1. The event, at the Marquis Theater in the Marriott Marquis hotel, followed a news conference attended by Fox Sports Media Group executives and two dozen sports announcers and anchors. Among them were Troy Aikman, Terry Bradshaw, Jimmy Johnson, Howie Long, Curt Menefee, Tim McCarver, Michael Strahan and the first new marquee employee of Fox Sports 1, Regis Philbin, who will host “Rush Hour,” a weekday talk show. “It is a historic day for us,” said David Hill, who led Fox Sports when it began two decades ago and will head the new channel. “We have been looking at a national sports channel with various degrees of seriousness for, I’d say, 15 years.” Toby Byrne, president for sales at Fox Broadcasting Company and Fox Sports Media Group, asked for the order, to use a familiar sales phrase. “As of today, we’ll be open for business,” he said, adding that the channel had good potential because “the appetite for sports seems insatiable.” The channel is being started because News Corporation was able to secure enough sports programming for it, Mr. Byrne said, along with distribution in 90 million homes from cable system operators. “With programming and distribution, hopefully, come the viewers,” he said, “and then it’ll be a really appealing thing for the advertisers.” For those worried about withdrawal pains after three upfront events in one day, fear not. The NBCUniversal News Group division of NBCUniversal will hold an upfront luncheon on March 14.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com U.S. Inquiry of MF Global Gains Speed  |  The investigation into MF Global is intensifying as federal authorities unearth new details and confront potential obstacles in their hunt for roughly $1.2 billion in customer money that disappeared from the brokerage firm. While prosecutors and regulators have jointly conducted dozens of depositions with former and current employees, a senior executive in the Chicago office of MF Global recently declined to meet with the federal authorities, people briefed on the investigation said. That official, Edith O’Brien, a treasurer at MF Global, is considered a “person of interest” in the investigation, the people said.

		<content>Spinoff of Time Inc. Rattles Employees - NYTimes.com “There was a real sense that Jeff didn’t have either interest in Time Inc. and magazine publishing and didn’t have faith in it as a business going forward,” another former executive said. “His focus was always the film and TV side of the company.” In an interview with The New York Times last week, Mr. Bewkes said the spinoff was intended to help the magazines thrive and was in no way an indication of his lack of enthusiasm for the publishing business. “We still own it. Every one of us still owns it,” Mr. Bewkes said. Don Logan, the chief executive of Time Inc. from 1994 to 2002, noted just how challenging a task it was to transform a print magazine division for the digital age, even for Time Inc., which has such strong brands. “It’s not an easy company to manage,” Mr. Logan said. “It’s hard to balance this. I don’t fault anybody.” Time Inc. employees hope that as an independent company they now will be able to invest more in digital publishing, where they recognize they have plenty of catching up to do. Data provided by comScore shows that many of Time Inc.’s Web sites, including CNN Money, Sports Illustrated and People, all experienced declines in unique users between February 2012 and February 2013. And one year after it announced the departure of Steve Sachs, the consumer marketing executive who helped convert the magazines for iPads and other electronic readers, Time has not found a replacement. Current and former executives also hope that the new company can find the right leader, after missteps with its last two chief executives. Mr. Bewkes hired Jack Griffin in August 2010 then asked him to leave barely six months later, publicly rebuking his management style. After a nine-month search, he reached outside the publishing industry to hire Laura Lang, who had won accolades for transforming Digitas from a direct mail company to a successful digital advertising agency. But her attempts to bring the same type of digital transformation to Time Inc. proved more difficult. She struck a deal with Apple to make Time Inc.’s magazines available on the Apple newsstand, a major shift for Time Inc., which previously shunned Apple’s restrictions on subscriptions and consumer data. But several acquisitions she was considering were blocked by others at the company, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. And as revenue fell she was forced to resort to the layoffs, which only alienated more employees. “It’s not like a piece is being fixed or its bureaucracy is going to be aligned,” said a current Time Inc. executive, referring to the new company. “If you keep doing the same thing, you’re going to have the same results.”</content>

		<content>Tempers Flare Over Texas Wind Farm Plan - NYTimes.com Article Tools News last week of the first major influx of Chinese capital and wind turbine manufacturing expertise into the renewable energy market in the United States — a 600-megawatt wind farm planned for the plains of west Texas — had many readers of the Green Inc. blog in a state of agitation, The New York Times’s Tom Zeller Jr. writes. “I don’t understand why China is exporting wind energy to the U.S.,” wrote Mark from New York City. “Isn’t this exactly the kind of project a United States company could and should be doing?” Another reader — Drew from Boston — was more blunt: “Again, China is playing the West for a sucker,” he wrote. “We send them our engineering, they get the manufacturing work and experience.” The details of the deal known so far: Contingent on financing from Chinese commercial banks — and no small measure of funding from the United States economic stimulus package — A-Power Energy Generation Systems, a Nasdaq-listed company based in the Chinese industrial city of Shenyang, would provide 240 of its 2.5-megawatt wind turbines for a 36,000-acre utility-scale wind farm in west Texas to be operated by Cielo Wind Power, a developer based in Austin. The total cost of the project, which was brokered in part by the U.S. Renewable Energy Group, an American private equity company, was estimated at $1.5 billion. At an event after the announcement in Washington on Thursday, Cappy McGarr, a managing partner at the company, was beaming. “This planned $1.5 billion investment in wind energy will spur tremendous growth in the renewable energy sector,” Mr. McGarr was quoted in a news release as saying, “and directly create hundreds of high-paying American jobs.” The devil, though — as many observers pointed out by the end of the week — is in the details. The group’s calculations last week put the number of American jobs at a little more than 300 — most of them temporary construction jobs, along with about 30 permanent positions once the wind farm is operating. Mr. McGarr told The Wall Street Journal that more than 2,000 Chinese jobs would be created by the deal. That, along with the fact that the project was hoping to secure 30 percent, or $450 million, of its financing from stimulus funds, was enough to send tempers flaring. “Why are U.S. stimulus funds being used to subsidize manufacturing jobs in China,” wrote a reader at Green Inc., who pointed out that American officials had repeatedly warned that the United States could lose its competitive edge on renewable energy manufacturing to China. And yet, he continued, “the federal government gives stimulus monies to subsidize a project buying turbines made in China. Why?” Part of the agitation almost certainly arises from China’s own reputation for green protectionism. As Keith Bradsher wrote earlier this year in The New York Times, by establishing prohibitive quotas for homegrown solar and wind turbine equipment, and disqualifying bids from foreign companies on dubious grounds, the Chinese leadership has muscled out American and European manufacturers of clean energy seeking to gain a foothold in China’s burgeoning market for renewables. As it happens, American officials made inroads in combating such trade barriers during a meeting of the United States-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade in Hangzhou, China, last week. Among the outcomes of the meeting: China agreed to remove local-content requirements on wind turbines. Still, with the American economy struggling to get back on its feet and with an analysis last week from The Associated Press suggesting that the White House may be guilty of overstating the number of American jobs its $787 billion stimulus package has so far created, news that a Texas wind farm would create thousands of green jobs in China was, for some, a bitter pill. “Thank you for killing the U.S. windmill industry,” wrote a reader from Chicago at Green Inc. “Thank-you, U.S. industrialists and financiers, for having us buy these things with financing and grants emanating from money borrowed from China.” The deal, however, was no surprise to Russ Choma, a reporter with the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a nonprofit investigative journalism project attached to the American University School of In a somewhat intriguing coincidence of timing, Mr. Choma and his colleagues published, on the same day the Chinese-American wind farm deal was unveiled, a detailed analysis of where stimulus money aimed at creating renewable energy projects and jobs in the United States was flowing. By Mr. Choma’s reckoning, 84 percent of the $1.05 billion in clean-energy grants distributed by the government since Sept. 1 has gone to foreign renewable energy companies — specifically, wind companies. Through its American subsidiary, Iberdrola, a global manufacturer of wind turbines based in Spain, commanded most of that funding: $545 million. “We broke down some of the numbers and found out that the program funded 11 projects that installed 982 turbines,” Mr. Choma wrote in an e-mail message, “and 695 were built by foreign manufacturers.” To some extent, this is hardly surprising. As Mr. Choma noted, the American clean energy manufacturing base — particularly its wind turbine production capability — is tiny compared with that of Europe. And to be sure, the dispensation of the $22 billion in stimulus funding that is supposed to go toward renewable energy projects has only just begun. But China’s foray into the American wind power market comes alongside its dominance of the solar panel manufacturing industry, in which 95 percent of total output is exported to the United States and Europe. And as Mr. Choma noted, when it comes to stimulating the economy, it is the manufacturing that matters. He points to a 2004 study from the Renewable Energy Policy Project, a research institute based in Washington. The institute found that every 1,000 megawatts of installed wind capacity had the potential to generate as many as 4,300 jobs, of which about 3,000 are created at the manufacturing level.

		<content>Fender Aims to Stay Plugged In Amid Changing Music Trends - NYTimes.com The company has also been criticized by Wall Street analysts for acquiring the Kaman Music Corporation, a distributor of musical instruments and accessories, in 2008 for $117 million. The company, which it renamed KMC Music, is a low-margin business and has squeezed Fender’s overall profit margins. Fender filed to go public in an initial stock offering in March, in a deal that would have valued the company at as much as $396 million.  That is a pittance by Facebook standards. But the price was high for a company of Fender’s size. Bankers and investors scoffed. Fender, they said, was trying to go public as a “growth” company when its sales were declining. The talk on Wall Street was that Weston Presidio was pushing to sell at a high price. Weston executives declined to comment. “They saw a window and said let’s try to hit it and maybe no one will pay attention to the negative sales trends,” Mr. Ursaner says. “It was banking at its worst.” In documents filed in connection with the proposed initial public offering, Fender outlined avenues that it contended would bolster growth, such as sales to emerging markets like China and India, the addition of more licensing and co-branding deals, and strategic acquisitions. Mr. Bronchick, the analyst, speculates that investment bankers didn’t wanted to take the offer at such a high valuation. AT Fender, Mr. Mendello doesn’t rule out a future public offering. Fender might try again sooner rather than later, because about $237 million of its $246 million in long-term debt will be due in 2014. Mr. Mendello, who owns 4.8 percent of Fender, says he isn’t looking to cash out personally. Neither are the company’s other shareholders, he says. “I love Fender — it’s the greatest company in the world,” he says. “We’re here for the long-term, and we’re going to do what’s right for Fender.”</content>

		<content>In Bank Settlements, Fines but No Accountability - NYTimes.com Edgard Garrido/ReutersSeveral agencies and authorities were involved in the settlement with HSBC. The global banking giant HSBC reached a settlement on Tuesday with the Justice Department and other federal agencies that requires the bank to pay about $1.9 billion and beef up its compliance measures. That is a hefty price for failing to make any real effort to comply with United States laws that prohibit dealings with countries like Iran or to monitor its accounts to prevent money laundering. The deferred prosecution agreement HSBC signed follows what has become the norm for resolving investigations into misconduct by financial institutions. On Monday, Standard Chartered announced that it had received a deferred prosecution agreement requiring the bank to pay $327 million to avoid charges over its dealings with companies doing business in Iran and Sudan. The $2.2 billion that the government received from HSBC and Standard Chartered in two days is not a bad result, and it comes on top of the $619 million paid by the ING Group in June for transactions it conducted with entities of Iran and Cuba. White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools Related Links HSBC to Pay $1.92 Billion to Settle Money Laundering Charges By using deferred prosecution agreements, the Justice Department gets most of what it wants out of a case: an admission of violations, a significant monetary penalty and a promise of future compliance. But the frequent use of these agreements raises the question of whether banks have come to regard them as just another cost of doing business. HSBC and Standard Chartered both pointed to the new leaf they have turned over in response to the investigations. A statement by Standard Chartered said, “In the more than five years since the events giving rise to today’s settlements, the bank has completed a comprehensive review and upgrade of its compliance systems and procedures.” For its part, HSBC’s statement proclaimed that it had “taken extensive and concerted steps to put in place the highest standards for the future.” As part of its settlement, HSBC will have to pay for an independent monitor for the next five years, and the bank said it would spend approximately $700 million to review all of its files to help weed out questionable accounts. HSBC is still part of a wide-ranging investigation into the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a case in which two other banks, UBS and Barclays, have reached settlements. Resolving the case will cost HSBC more money, especially because of the potential for private lawsuits claiming violations of antitrust laws, which can result in triple damages. HSBC has also been implicated in tax evasion investigations by account holders using its branches in offshore tax havens. The penalties in those cases could easily run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Entering into a deferred prosecution agreement allows a bank to avoid having the black mark of a criminal conviction on their record. While the bank admits to the facts constituting a violation, compliance with the terms of the agreement means that prosecutors will not file charges. That is important because under federal law, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can revoke a bank’s insurance for engaging “in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of the depository institution” that results in a criminal conviction. Prosecutors have only rarely filed charges against bank insiders for serious violations like those which HSBC and Standard Chartered have admitted took place. Indeed, this is the recurring pattern in the settlements reached by the Justice Department: the company acknowledges guilt, pays a large penalty and promises not to violate the law again. While the Justice Department would doubtless like to go after some bank executives, pursuing cases against individuals can be much more difficult because proof of intent to violate the law is hard to establish when an employee is just one tiny part of a larger organization. In a civil fraud trial last summer involving the sale of a troubled security, the defendant successfully offered the “Where’s Waldo?” defense to deflect blame onto more senior corporate officials involved in the deal. Pursuing charges against senior officers can be even more difficult. These managers may well turn a blind eye to what is happening, happy to see the profits roll in from questionable transactions, but that is usually not enough to prove a willful violation of the law. It remains frustrating that cases involving major criminal misconduct by financial institutions most often result in a large fine and a commitment to follow the law, while individuals are not held to account – leaving the impression that, for the banking sector, these settlements have become little more than expensive parking tickets.

		<content>A.I.G. Interviewing Banks on Alico I.P.O., Report Says - NYTimes.com Article Tools American International Group is interviewing banks this week to manage a planned initial public offering of the life insurance unit, the American Life Insurance Company, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. An I.P.O. could fetch as much as $5 billion for the unit, known as Alico, depending on the size of the stake that is sold, according to Reuters. A.I.G. has said it planned to list the company in New York. About 10 banks, including UBS, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group and Goldman Sachs Group, are expected to be interviewed for the job, Reuters said, citing the sources. Morgan Stanley is expected to get a lead role as it has been guaranteed such a position by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for any I.P.O. of A.I.G. units, according to the news service. An I.P.O. of Alico is expected only after the public offering of shares in another major A.I.G. property, the American International Assurance Company, which has been slated for early next year, one of the sources told Reuters. Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank have been selected as global coordinators for the A.I.A. offering. A.I.G. and all the banks declined to comment, Reuters said. Alico, which was founded in 1921, sells life insurance and retirement products to 19 million customers through a distribution network that includes 40,000 agents. It operates in 54 countries but generates more than half of its revenue in Japan. In July, another source told Reuters that A.I.G. was in talks with MetLife Inc. for a possible sale of Alico. The status of those talks could not be determined on Tuesday, Reuters said. Late last month, A.I.G.’s new chief executive, Robert Benmosche, said the company was still planning I.P.O.’s for Alico and A.I.A., preparing them from an eventual sale when the time was right. The divestitures are part of the insurer’s efforts to repay American taxpayers the roughly $80 billion it received as part of a larger federal rescue. The company has agreed to give the federal government preferred stakes in Alico and A.I.A. to reduce its debt by $25 billion. Separately, Credit Suisse downgraded A.I.G. to “underperform” from “neutral,” saying near-term sale of businesses would leave little to no value for common equity holders. A.I.G.’s shares were off $3.58, or 8.9 percent, at $36.47 during afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</content>

		<content>Cost of ‘12 Days of Christmas’ Totals $107,300 - NYTimes.com The verses of the holiday classic “The 12 Days of Christmas” add up to 364 gifts, and if your true love bought them all, they would cost $107,300, a 6.1 percent increase compared with . That is also more than double the giver’s bill of nearly $52,000 in 1995, the lowest annual total for the old-fashioned gifts and services. The cost of the 12 days of cumulative gifts is calculated annually by PNC Wealth Management, part of the , to come up with an amusing and easily understandable explanation of how the country’s economy is faring. Instead of sticking to the pedestrian items like food, gasoline and electricity that make up the federal , PNC tracks the cost of the carol’s more whimsical list, which ranges from a partridge to a group of leaping lords, to explain how prices affect the economy. This year, the prices of the six geese, seven swans and other fowl rose because the country’s drought drove up the price of bird feed. The five golden rings named in the song’s verses also cost significantly more than a year ago. Higher demand for gold stems from an improving economy, said James P. Dunigan, PNC Wealth Management’s managing executive of investments, who oversees compilation of the index. “The rise is larger than expected considering the modest economic growth we’ve had,” he said. This year, buying just one of each gift enumerated in the song would cost $25,431, a 4.8 percent increase over last year. After nearly three decades of tracking prices, PNC found that its final tabulation often mirrored the Consumer Price Index, which includes a much broader range of goods. It was up 1.87 percent for the 12 months that ended in November. The gap between the two indexes is caused in part by the price of feed but also to lower energy prices. The six-figure outlay to accumulate all the gifts is unlikely to faze those with deep pockets, but there is still room for a holiday bargain with the milking maids, ladies dancing and leaping lords as well as with the calling birds, turtle doves and partridge. The eight maids, who are considered unskilled labor, cost $58, still a deal because the minimum wage remained at $7.25 an hour. Musicians like the 11 pipers and the 12 drummers were a bit more expensive, at $2,562 and $2,775. Each group received a 5.5 percent raise over last year, based on information from music groups and unions. The nine ladies dancing received no raise, remaining at $6,294. Pushing up the final bill, however, were the geese, which soared by 29.6 percent, to $210 each, up from $162, as corn and other bird feed costs jumped. The seven trumpeter swans could be found for $7,000, up 11.1 percent. Also up 11.8 percent was the cost of a pear tree, which rose $20, to $189.99, an increase that Mr. Dunigan said reflected a better housing market. In the song, the pear tree is a perch for the partridge, but in contemporary life, it is a tree often used in residential landscaping. The gold rings this year rose by 16.3 percent, to $750 from $645 last year. The three French hens totaled $165, an increase of 10 percent from last year’s $150. The partridge is the cheapest item, at $15, and the swans, at $1,000 each, are the most expensive. The availability and price of swans greatly fluctuates every year, and each annual PNC list factors in the final gift total both with and without the swans. Online shoppers will find assembling the parade of fowl and performers easier and more convenient, but shipping costs make the final bill much higher. The cost to give one set of items rises to $40,440 when buying is done online. To draw up the list, Mr. Dunigan said, PNC consulted sources like the National Aviary in Pittsburgh for bird prices, and organizations like the Pennsylvania Ballet Company in Philadelphia for the going rates paid to performers. To arrive at the price of the 14-carat gold rings, PNC checked with a national jewelry retailer. Gold prices dipped last year after purchasers balked at higher prices for wedding rings and other fine gold jewelry, and they are fluctuating this year. To help students understand prices and how they affect the economy, PNC comes up with a new Web site each year to illustrate the index items. PNC worked with the advertising and digital agency Deutsch Inc. on the site, The site, which uses Google Street View, lets users check far-flung places for the goods and services on the PNC index and to learn about them — or browse historical information.

		<content>Analysis-Nigeria Faces Long, Bumpy Road to Making the Lights Work - NYTimes.com ABUJA (Reuters) - In an unwanted daily routine lasting 17 years, Phillip Cleatus sits in the dark doorway of his shoe-making shop in Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna, waiting for the lights to come back on. President Goodluck Jonathan is trying to persuade Cleatus and some 170 million other Nigerians that will soon change. Yet while his plan to privatise power is creeping forward, it is likely to take decades to end the chronic electricity shortages that are among the main barriers to investment and growth in Africa's second biggest economy and top oil producer. Nigeria is in the process of breaking up the defunct state power company into 17 private generation and distribution companies and selling them for about $2.5 billion (1.6 billion pounds) in total, as part of efforts to increase electricity output tenfold over the next seven years. It might be its most advanced effort yet to end its perennial power shortfall, but progress has been so slow that Jonathan's targets look far too optimistic. Industry experts believe some improvements will be felt in 2-3 years. If Nigeria gets the lights working it would reduce business costs by up to 40 percent, add 3 percent to GDP and cut the mass unemployment that fuels unrest seen in oil theft in the south and a bloody Islamist insurgency in the north, economists say. It could also spur a boom in labour intensive areas like manufacturing, food processing, textiles and pharmaceuticals, while opening up the opportunity for new low-cost service industries like the call centres that aided India's rise. The $13 billion a year that Nigerians spend on diesel, most of which is imported, would be a bill of the past. Power from generators costs more than twice as much as from the grid. "This is killing my business, I lose 45 percent of my annual profit to poor power supply," Cleatus, 38, told Reuters. A glitzy ceremony hosted by Jonathan last week celebrated the first payment by private companies which are taking over the unbundled state electricity firm and a deal by the World Bank to give an initial $145 million risk guarantee for gas supply. A close look at the private companies which won bids shows a mix of oligarchs and influential figures connected to Nigeria's political elite, and some recognised technical partners like Siemens and Manila Electric. This has raised some questions about the expected efficiency of the privatisation process and what it can deliver, but there are those who argue that effective business in Nigeria is impossible without political connections and patrons. "Much has been achieved, yet the race will not be over until Nigerians can take electricity supply for granted," Jonathan told dignitaries and power companies last week at his villa. Electricity capacity had been in steady decline for a decade when Jonathan launched his reform plan in 2010, pledging Nigeria would boost generation from 3,000 megawatts (MW) to 10,000 MW by the end of this year, and 40,000 MW by 2020. Generation has increased to around 4,000 MW but experts say there is zero hope of meeting government targets, while the scale of the task means power output will initially fall after the privatisation is completed at the end of this year. Despite being Africa's top oil producer and holding the world's ninth largest gas reserves, Nigeria's power output is a tenth of South Africa's for a population three times the size. "It will probably take Nigeria another 50 years before it attains the same level of electricity consumption per capita as South Africa currently enjoys today," said David Ladipo, whose company Azura is spending $700 million to build a 450 MW plant. Ladipo thinks electricity output could grow to 6,000 MW in the next two years and to 9,000 MW by 2020, before seeing a potential boom as post-privatisation investment kicks in. One industry expert told Reuters Nigeria's potential demand is estimated to be as high as 140,000 MW and rising, so just keeping up with demand will be a huge challenge. Even Ladipo's more modest projections, which several other industry experts broadly agreed with, face hurdles. Privatisation is months behind schedule and government is struggling to get the funding it needs for crucial transmission and gas supply infrastructure. Powerful labour unions are blocking attempts to pay off 40,000 state electricity workers. Nigeria says it has found 340 billion naira ($2.1 billion) to pay off the workers, but they remain reluctant to leave. The African Development Bank is providing $150 million to aid with transmission and some of a $1 billion debut Eurobond would help with upgrades. But in Nigeria, just making the money available doesn't always mean it will be used wisely. Some $40 billion has gone into several power reform drives in the last 20 years, industry experts say, much of it wasted. "In the past the problem has not been capacity of government to find money for the power sector: billions have been allocated - and billions have been squandered or stolen," said Antony Goldman, head of Africa-focused PM Consulting. Still, there remains optimism that wrestling power out of government hands will eventually lead to progress. "Given the scale of the challenge and the history of the sector ... reform is progressing very well," said Fola Fabule, a Lagos-based investment banker focused on infrastructure finance.</content>

		<content>The Dell Deal Scorecard - NYTimes.com Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesA Dell booth at a trade fair this month in Hanover, Germany. With three suitors now in the mix for Dell Inc., it can be a little tough remembering who’s offering what and who’s working with whom. We’re here to help. Article Tools Here’s a breakdown of what each of the bidding groups — Michael S. Dell and Silver Lake; the Blackstone Group; and Carl C. Icahn — is proposing and who’s helping put the plans together. But it’s also worth noting that they aren’t completely alike: Mr. Dell and Silver Lake plan on taking completely control of Dell, while Blackstone and Mr. Icahn are each contemplating leaving some portion of the company in public shareholders hands. Michael Dell and Silver Lake Offering to pay $13.65 a share for all of Dell. Lined up a $2 billion loan from Microsoft. Mr. Dell has committed to contributing his roughly 16 percent stake and an additional $750 million. Silver Lake is providing $1.4 billion in equity capital. The group is being advised (and financed) by a bevy of banks: Bank of America, Barclays, Credit Suisse, the Royal Bank of Canada and now Citigroup as well. Microsoft was advised by Lazard. Mr. Dell is being counseled by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, and Silver Lake by Simpson Thacher and Bartlett. Blackstone Working with Francisco Partners and Insight Venture Partners. Proposing paying over $14.25 a share. Investors who want to maintain a stake in Dell can do so, though Blackstone hasn’t specified what percentage of the company will remain public. Has a “highly confident” letter of financing from Morgan Stanley, though it doesn’t yet have a committed loan and bond package. Its deal team is being led by Chinh E. Chu, the co-chair of the firm’s private equity committee, and David Johnson, the former senior vice president of corporate strategy at Dell. Has held discussions with “some of Dell’s largest shareholders,” which people briefed on the matter said includes Southeastern Asset Management, the biggest outside investor in the computer company and a vocal critic of Mr. Dell’s offer. Working with Morgan Stanley and the law firm Kirkland and Ellis. Icahn Owns 80 million shares, which he values around $1 billion and would contribute toward a deal. Would buy about 58.1 percent of Dell, leaving the rest publicly traded. Would pay $1 billion from Icahn Enterprises, his main investment vehicle, and would kick in an additional $3 billion from other sources of equity capital. Would make use of $7.4 billion of cash on hand at Dell, as well as borrowing $1.7 billion against receivables and $5.2 billion in new debt. Working with the Jefferies Group. Dell and Others The special board committee reviewing the three takeover offers is working with JPMorgan Chase, Evercore Partners and the law firm Debevoise and Plimpton. The company itself is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Hogan Lovells. Southeastern has retained the law firm Greenberg Traurig and the proxy solicitor D.F. King.</content>

		<content>Companies Pick Up Used Packaging, and Recycling’s Cost - NYTimes.com You might be doing both, as a result of a new trend in recycling, courtesy of the manufacturers who make the original products. A growing number of large food and beverage companies in the United States are assuming the costs of recycling their packaging after consumers are finished with it, a responsibility long imposed on packaged goods companies in Europe and more recently in parts of Asia, Latin America and Canada. Several factors are converging to make what is known as “extended producer responsibility” more attractive and, perhaps, more commonplace in the United States. “Local governments are literally going broke and so are looking for ways to shift the costs of recycling off onto someone, and companies that make the packaging are logical candidates,” said Jim Hanna, director of environmental impact at the Perhaps most important, he said, “companies are becoming more aware that resources are limited and what they’ve traditionally thrown away — wow, it has value.” It is now cheaper to recycle an aluminum can into a new can than it is to make one from virgin material, and the same is becoming true for plastic bottles. “Shredding, melting, recasting and rerolling used aluminum beverage cans into new aluminum can sheet saves 95 percent of the energy that it takes to make can sheet from raw ore,” said Beth Schmitt, director of recycling at Alcoa. The principle is the same with used plastic bottles, which are made from petroleum — and are one of the country’s largest exports to China, where they are used to make fabric fibers. “Tuna cans, cereal boxes, laundry detergent bottles — all of it has value in end markets that are thirsty for it,” said Michael Washburn, director of sustainability at Nestlé Waters North America, a bottled-water producer. So far, company-sponsored recycling efforts are voluntary in the United States. Many states have laws requiring companies to take responsibility for spent products like batteries and mercury switches, but so far, only that might shift the cost of discarded packaging to business. Passed in 2010, it established a framework that allows the state to add products, including packaging, to the list of those for which manufacturers must assume the costs of disposal. So far, however, no new products have been added. Opposition to mandated responsibility for packaging after use is widespread, even among companies that are already required to do it abroad. “We’re not convinced there’s compelling evidence that it’s the most appropriate solution for the U.S.,” said Meghan Stasz, director of sustainability at the Grocery Manufacturers Association, which represents more than 300 food, beverage and packaged goods companies. Nonetheless, a few prominent food and beverage companies are moving on their own to recapture their packaging after their customers are done with it. , devoted to its stated goal of ensuring the recycling of 100 percent of its cans and bottles in North America by 2015 and 50 percent in the rest of the world. To that end, seven factories owned wholly or in part by the company toil away around the globe recycling plastic, including one in Spartanburg, S.C. Coke is also experimenting with nonpetroleum-based packaging materials. Products like Dasani and Sprite come in PlantBottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, which are up to 30 percent plant-based and can go through the same process that regular, 100 percent oil-based PET bottles go through. The packaging has won awards and last year became a new source of revenue for Coke when the H. J. Heinz Company licensed it for use in its ketchup bottles. The company also places bins at events and locations like Nascar races to collect bottles for recycling. Asking customers to return packaging to bins is a growing trend among companies. Starbucks now has bins in which customers can deposit their cups at 18 percent of its stores in the United States and Canada, up from 5 percent just a year ago. The company has a goal of 100 percent by 2015. In Chicago, the company has developed a closed-loop system in which cups from its stores are trucked to a recycling facility in Green Bay, Wis., where they are mixed with other recycled material and turned into paper napkins that it uses in its stores. An article on Saturday about efforts by some companies to collect and recycle their own packaging misidentified the state in which one such company, the yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm, is based.

		<content>Bidders Said to Line Up for Cubs - NYTimes.com Article Tools The first bids for the storied Chicago Cubs and related assets were submitted on Friday in an auction that could fetch more than $1 billion, according to Reuters. As expected, entrepreneur Mark Cuban and private equity veteran John Canning Jr. were said to be among the bidders. At least 10 potential owner groups have reportedly been approved by Major League Baseball to bid on the Cubs, as well as its home ballpark, Wrigley Field, and a stake in a sports TV network. According to Reuters, the source, who asked not to be identified because the sale process is continuing, also submitted an indication of interest for all three assets. The Tribune Company, which owns the Cubs as well as The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times, among other media assets, is taking bids on any combination of the Cubs-related assets in an effort to maximize its return. It is selling the team and other assets to pay down billions of dollars of debt it took on when it went private in an $8.2 billion deal led by real estate magnate Sam Zell. The media company recently failed to reach a deal to sell Wrigley Field to the state of Illinois. The Chicago Sun Times reported on Thursday that 20 bids have been submitted for Wrigley Field alone, including one from Inland Real Estate Corp., which operates shopping centers located mostly in the Midwest. A second source familiar with the situation told Reuters that at least 10 bids were expected for the three assets, and another 10 to 15 for Wrigley alone. Cubs Chairman Crane Kenney referred questions to Tribune, which said its goal was the highest return. “We have every intention of maximizing the value of the Cubs and the ballpark assets. It’s a great season to be marketing them,” Tribune spokesman Gary Weitman told Reuters in an e-mail, referring to the Cubs’ status as having the best record in the National League. Bidders are anxious to take control of the team, which is aiming for its first World Series title since 1908. The Cubs are nationally recognized due to the team’s history as lovable losers and its national exposure on cable television. “It’s a great franchise,” said Andrew Murstein, vice chairman of Sports Properties Acquisition Corp., which raised $215 million in January in an initial public offering. “Hopefully, people will think with their wallet and not with their heart.” Mr. Murstein, a New York City taxi tycoon, told Reuters that his group, which includes former baseball home run king Henry Aaron and former Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp, submitted a bid for all three assets, as well as one for just the team and TV network stake. “We’re not going to chase the deal,” Mr. Murstein said . “With us, it’s not going to be an ego buy.” According to The Chicago Tribune, bidders also include Mr. Canning, chairman of Chicago-based private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners; Mr. Cuban, and Internet entrepreneur who also owns of the National Basketball Association Dallas Mavericks; and the family of Joe Ricketts, the founder of Omaha, TD Ameritrade Holding. Additional bidders reportedly include a group headed by Michael Tokarz, chairman of MVC Capital Inc. ; Don Levin, owner of the Chicago Wolves minor league hockey team; Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns several Broadway theaters; and a group that includes Leo Hindery, who runs private equity firm InterMedia Partners and previously ran Yes Network, the TV channel of the New York Yankees baseball team, and ATandT Broadband. Two other groups that have not been identified include hedge fund investors, according to Reuters. Four to five bidders are expected to make it to the next round of the auction, with binding proposals expected shortly after the end of the baseball season, the news service said. The regular season ends in late September and playoffs could last into late October. The sale could close by year-end or very early next year. Tribune plans to keep a 5 percent stake in the team in a deal that could save the company millions of dollars in taxes, according to Reuters.

		<content>Chinese Manufacturing Growth Slows - NYTimes.com BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly slowed in April as new export orders fell, raising fresh doubts about the strength of the economy after a disappointing first quarter. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.6 in April from an 11-month high in March of 50.9. Analysts had expected the April PMI to be 51.0. The pull back on the official PMI mirrored a similar decline in a preliminary HSBC PMI last week, suggesting China's exports engine faces headwinds from the euro zone recession and sluggish growth in the United States. China's new government has signaled it will step up infrastructure investment, which analysts said will provide support for the economy in the second quarter. "Overall, my general feel is that China is growing but slower than people expected say a month ago," said Alvin Pontoh, economist at TDSecurities in Singapore. "But I don't think this is reason for alarm... this is probably what the new administration is looking for. Structurally, China cannot grow at 9 or 10 percent any more, so over the next few years, you'd reasonably expect growth to edge lower to say 7 percent or so". A string of global data, including lower than expected U.S. economic growth figures, has dented optimism seen at the start of the year that the world economy was picking up. Market reaction to the PMI was muted as many countries in Asia and Europe are marking May 1 Labor Day holiday. China's markets are closed and will reopen on Thursday. Benchmark three-month copper slipped and weighed on mining stocks in Australia following the PMI figures. The Australian and New Zealand dollars held their ground. The official PMI figures showed a new orders sub-index fell to 51.7 in April from 52.3 in March, holding above 50 which separates expansion from contraction compared with a month earlier. However, the new export orders index fell to 48.6 from 50.9 in March, suggesting they were shrinking. "The dip in April PMI shows that the foundation for China's economic recovery is still not solid," Zhang Liqun, an economist at the Development Research Centre, a top government think tank in Beijing, said in an emailed statement accompanying the index. "All these show the possibility for China's growth to slow slightly in the future. We must work to stabilize domestic demand and make our economic recovery more sustainable," he said. HSBC's preliminary PMI for April fell to 50.5 from 51.6 in March as new export orders shrank. The final reading is scheduled to be published on Thursday. The latest PMI adds risks to market expectations that China's annual economic expansion will pick up to 8.0 percent in the April-June quarter after it slipped in January to March to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent in the previous quarter. Zhiwei Zhang, a China economist at Nomura, said in a client note before the PMI figures that he expects growth to ease again in the second quarter to 7.5 percent. Apart from expectations of more infrastructure investment, the central bank will hold rates steady throughout 2013, as it needs to tread a delicate balance between inflation and growth, a Reuters poll showed. "We still expect major activity indicators to show a moderate growth recovery in April and 2Q. On policies, we expect overall monetary and fiscal policies to remain accommodative, though we see no need for significant stimulus," said Ting Lu, a Hong-Kong-based China economist from Bank of America Merril Lynch, in a note to clients. Beijing is targeting 2013 growth of 7.5 percent, lower than the double digit levels of most of the past three decades as it tries to shift the economy to reduce reliance on exports and more towards consumption. Still, the recovery from seven-straight quarters of a slowdown through the third quarter of 2012 has been uneven so far. Growth picked up in the fourth quarter but then slipped in the first quarter of this year despite a credit boom in January through March. China's debt-ridden local governments used new lending to repay existing loans instead of channeling the money into new investment, analysts said. The government has promised to heighten scrutiny of local government financing vehicles, wealth management products and the country's fledgling bond market. The politburo, the top decision-making body, said in a meeting last week China would speed up the establishment of a regulatory system for local government debt financing while strengthening oversight on potential financial risks. Shadow banking, a main driver of a credit surge in recent months, has provided a lifeline though to property funding, fuelling unwelcome housing inflation. New home prices jumped 3.6 percent in March from a year ago, a third straight monthly increase despite an intensified government tightening campaign during the past three years.</content>

		<content>‘Alchemists’ Looks at Central Bankers’ Handling of Crisis - NYTimes.com NEIL IRWIN admires central bankers, and maybe he has a point. With the interplay of Congress and the presidency bordering on the dysfunctional these days, is there a more accomplished Washington figure than the scholarly and respected Europe still lurches from one numbing financial debacle to another, with no resolution in sight. For better or (as many say) worse, the European Central Bank has tried to rescue governments from looming defaults on debt, imposing pain and sacrifice on Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and, most recently, Cyprus. Though critics say the European bank is using monetary policy to force fundamental changes better left to elected politicians, others say that at least it has the backbone to act. Mr. Irwin, a Washington Post columnist who covered the Fed in the financial crisis, has provided an accessible, engrossing account of the tribulations that Mr. Bernanke, with Mervyn A. King of the Bank of England and of the European Central Bank, endured in pulling the world financial system back from collapse. Mr. Irwin’s new book, “ : Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire” (Penguin Press, $29.95), describes a learned order of government bankers and economists who meet often, sharing “a closeness unheard-of elsewhere in international relations.” “They speak the same language,” he says, observing that central bankers “understand more deeply than perhaps anyone else where other countries are coming from.” Why do we care? “Mankind has given them incredible power.” Many revelations of “what really happened” behind the scenes in politics tend to rely on one or two good sources who blab. Not true of this one. Mr. Irwin seems to have talked with everyone, read the right scholarly papers and interviewed important dissenters in the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bundesbank. Much of his sourcing was on “deep background,” but he has produced a well-rounded account. He has a nice touch for translating central banking’s mysteries, opaque and forbidding, into understandable English. He is astute in describing the internal and external politics of institutions traditionally expected to remain above politics of the usual sort. He may tell you more than you want to know about the subtleties of picking a new president for the European Central Bank. But he shows how in its hour of need, the Fed, supposedly a political naif, was more than a match for its Congressional foes in the financial crisis. In 2009, after the wildly unpopular bailout of big banks, political rage toward the Fed was bipartisan and extreme. bill around stripping the Fed of its power to regulate banks. The libertarian Representative Ron Paul, a Republican, was pushing a proposal for Congress to audit the institution, a mandate that sailed through the House. Mr. Bernanke’s first term as chairman was running out. Senator Dodd saw his proposal melt like ice in the noonday sun. Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, insisted that the very largest banks remain under the Fed’s watch. Smaller banks lobbied to keep the Fed’s 12 regional reserve banks as their regulator, making a populist case that the arrangement was a counterweight to dominance by Washington and New York. One Dodd proposal would have required presidential appointees, rather than each bank’s board of directors, to select the 12 reserve bank presidents, including the powerful New York Fed president, but that idea went nowhere. The Paul demand was watered down to tolerable. And Mr. Bernanke, easy to denounce but too capable to be spared, comfortably won reappointment. Though the book’s accounts of the euro zone’s crises are at least as intricate, savvy and detailed, the Fed inevitably takes center stage. Mr. Irwin is by no means a starry-eyed acolyte, yet there is little doubt his sympathies lie with Mr. Bernanke. He admires the chairman’s efforts to devise novel ways to pump money into a faltering economy. “The Fed created so many emergency lending facilities,” Mr. Irwin says, “that a document just listing and summarizing them required a legal-size piece of paper covered in small type.” Mr. Bernanke’s Fed did what he decided it had to do, and never looked back. “For nearly a century, the Fed had been lender of last resort to American banks,” Mr. Irwin writes. “In the space of three months, it expanded that role to encompass both banks headquartered across Europe and the masters of the investment universe on Wall Street.” The author has written a squarely centrist account, echoing conventional wisdom that might place Mr. Bernanke second only to the sainted Paul A. Volcker in the pantheon of Fed chairmen. The book mentions but never really explores concerns by more conservative bankers that the central banks have fatally jeopardized their independence by plunging into political thickets beyond their brief. Nor does the book give more than passing attention to criticism from the left, voiced most insistently by Paul Krugman, who in New York Times columns loudly deplored Though Mr. Bernanke vowed that the Fed would never repeat its dreadful mistakes of willful inaction during the Depression, Mr. Krugman accused him Yet there are limits to the central bankers’ accomplishments and an apt double meaning to Mr. Irwin’s title, “The Alchemists.” Wizardry, yes, but the true alchemists never succeeded in transforming ordinary metals into gold. For all the bankers’ learned theories and late-night deliberations, American economic growth remains sluggish and Europe still suffers from rising unemployment and stagflation. So, Mr. Irwin writes, their triumph is what didn’t happen: “As ugly as the global economy looked five years after the onset of crisis, no war had broken out among the great global powers. Europe remained united. There had been no confidence-shattering hyperinflation or, outside of perhaps Greece and Spain, economic depression. None of this was a certainty.” As he puts it: “It may seem like damning with faint praise, but a catastrophe averted is no small thing.”</content>

		<content>A Digital Shift on Health Data Swells Profits in an Industry - NYTimes.com This industry, which was pioneered in the late 1970s, first gained widespread attention in 2004 when President Bush in his State of the Union speech called for digitizing national health records. “After that, every technology C.E.O. wanting a piece of health care would have visited me every day if I had let them,” said David Brailer, whom President Bush appointed as the nation’s first health information czar. Over the next few years, Cerner and many of the other health care data companies increased their presence on Capitol Hill. The records systems sold by the biggest vendors have their fans, who argue that, among other things, the systems ease prescribing medications electronically. But these systems also have many critics, who contend that they can be difficult to use, cannot share patient information with other systems and are sometimes adding hours to the time physicians spend documenting patient care. “On a really good day, you might be able to call the system mediocre, but most of the time, it’s lousy,” said Michael Callaham, the chairman of the department of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center, which eight months ago turned on its $160 million digital records system from Epic. Michael Blum, the hospital’s chief medical information officer, said a majority of doctors there like the Epic system. Whatever the case, the legislation has been a windfall to top executives at the leading health records companies. Neal L. Patterson, who grew up on a farm near Manchester, Okla., population 100, co-founded Cerner in 1979. As Cerner’s sales have soared in recent years, so have Mr. Patterson’s fortunes. From 2007 to 2011, he received more than $21 million in total compensation, according to the In recent years, Mr. Patterson and his wife, Jeanne Lillig-Patterson, who ran as a Republican for Congress in 2004, have emerged as social and business leaders in the Kansas City, Mo., area. Mr. Patterson is also co-owner of a real estate development firm whose ventures include a 1,200-acre community near Kansas City called the Village of Loch Lloyd, featuring a Tom Watson-designed golf course. The medical records industry did not have much of a presence in Washington before President Bush highlighted it in 2004. Then in November that year, the industry created its first association, HIMSS, which includes health care providers, corporations and not-for-profit organizations, to make the case for electronic records. Its founding members included Allscripts, Cerner and Epic. to President-elect Obama calling for a minimum government investment of $25 billion to help hospitals and physicians adopt electronic records. The industry ultimately got at least $19 billion in federal and state money. In the months after that windfall arrived, sales climbed for leading vendors as hospitals and physicians scrambled to buy systems to meet tight timetables to collect the incentive dollars. At Allscripts, Mr. Tullman soon announced what looked like a game-changing deal: the acquisition of another records company, Eclipsys, for $1.3 billion. “We are at the beginning of what we believe will be the fastest transformation of any industry in U.S. history,” Mr. Tullman said when the deal was announced. Last spring, some of the Eclipsys board members left after a power struggle; Mr. Tullman left in December. He is now at a company he co-founded that focuses on — another area that, after Obama administration and Congress expanded government incentives in the 2009 stimulus bill, has been swept by a gold-rush mentality, too. An article on Wednesday about the outsize profits accruing to sellers of medical records systems from a federal program they lobbied for omitted part of the name of the institution that employs Michael Callaham and Michael Blum, who expressed opposite viewpoints on how well one such system, from a company called Epic, worked. It is the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center — not merely the San Francisco Medical Center. Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the growth of electronic medical records and the profits of records companies misidentified an organization founded in November 2004 to make the case for electronic records. It is HIMSS, a group that includes health care providers, corporations and nonprofit organizations — not the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society EHR Vendor Association, a more narrowly focused trade group.</content>

		<content>Avoiding the Pitfalls of a Windfall - NYTimes.com AS sources of anxiety go, receiving a large sum of money must rank far down the list. But managing a windfall can be a stressful, hazardous undertaking. While most people might be willing to take their chances, financial planners warn that great care must be taken to avoid financial and psychological pitfalls and ensure that a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is not wasted. Beneficiaries of a substantial payday, like a lottery winner, an heir to an estate or a shareholder in a company that goes public, may suddenly confront a wide range of life choices that they scarcely could have imagined. That is why the first recommendation that planners make to recipients of a windfall — an amount far beyond what they are accustomed to, not any particular dollar figure — is often to do nothing. “One thing we counsel people to do is live beneath their means,” said Leslie Lassiter, head of the Los Angeles office of J. P. Morgan Private Wealth Management, adding that someone coming into a lot of cash should “park it in a very safe place so you can absorb it.” firm, has means that provide ample headroom to live beneath. Still, he found a wait-and-see approach useful when he received a sizable payment after the 2010 initial public offering of the Green Dot Corporation, a provider of prepaid charge cards that he cofounded. “Spend the day after your windfall like you spent the day before your windfall,” he advised. “Many of the things you thought you wanted are going to seem less desirable. You can only spend a dollar once, so spend it wisely.” Mr. Greenleaf prefers not to say how many dollars he took away from the I.P.O., but he acknowledged that it was enough to make him, in the current vernacular, a 1 percenter. Based on his experience, he encourages windfall recipients to make estimated tax payments the first order of business and then to clear all debt off their families’ books, including mortgages. “You’ll have greater comfort knowing your home is paid off and your loved ones provided for,” he said. “You’re going to feel good, but you’re going to find it very sobering. You’ll realize you have a lot less than you first thought.” Feelings of all sorts come into play when people come into money. Some do more harm than good, Elizabeth Ruch, a financial planner at Waddell and Reed in San Diego, has found. Certain windfall recipients are “afraid to do anything, and suffer from absolute paralysis,” she said, while others rush out to “buy that 96-inch TV or a new car.” I.P.O. beneficiaries often fall into the spendthrift group. Their attitude, Ms. Ruch observed, is, “ ‘I have slaved at this company and done without this and that. Now it’s my time.’ ” Lottery winners can also let windfall money slip through their fingers or have it pried loose. They “tend to be the ones, because they didn’t do anything to earn it, who give to people who appear out of the woodwork,” she said. “They feel guilty not giving money to a friend or their brother.” One way to avoid poor decisions driven by emotion is to rely on professional advisers, like accountants, financial planners and lawyers, said Ms. Lassiter of J. P. Morgan. Apart from expertise in their fields that can help windfall recipients when it comes time to decide how to invest or spend their money, they bring detachment and dispassion. Good advisers can say no to “friends and relatives with their hands out,” she said. Perhaps more important, they can say no to the person who pays them. “You want someone who’s going to level with you and not sugarcoat it,” she said. Another reason that windfalls are mismanaged is that they are often a bolt from the blue. Someone who cashes in on an I.P.O. may be in a better position than other recipients because I.P.O.’s tend to be carefully orchestrated, so the payday is expected. “What we see in Silicon Valley is more premeditated windfalls,” said Ronald Gong, managing director for family office services at Harris myCFO, a Palo Alto, Calif., financial planning service. “When you preplan, you have an ability to put a proper structure in place and set goals. It’s the same race with a different starting point.” Technology I.P.O.’s are back in fashion; LinkedIn, Pandora and other Internet companies have sold themselves to the public in the last year, and Facebook has filed to go public this spring. While Ms. Ruch said I.P.O. beneficiaries were especially eager to break out their wallets after a windfall, Mr. Gong said the bust after previous technology booms had made this generation more cautious. “The lesson learned in the last decade is that it’s O.K. to take money off the table and be conservative,” he said. “People get used to wealth gradually, not in one night.” By emphasizing patience and prudence, financial planners and Mr. Greenleaf remind recipients that a windfall really is a once-in-a-lifetime event. It may not allow them to change their lives radically, but if it is handled right, it can add security and comfort to enhance the lives they already have.</content>

		<content>Linn Energy to Buy Berry Petroleum for $2.5 Billion - NYTimes.com Deal-making in the oil patch continued on Thursday, as Linn Energy agreed to buy the Berry Petroleum Company for about $2.5 billion, expanding its presence in oil-rich shale formations. Under the terms of the deal, an affiliate of Linn, LinnCo L.L.C., will issue 1.25 million new common shares for each Berry share. That amounts to $46.24 a share, a premium of roughly 20 percent to Berry’s closing price on Wednesday. Article Tools Related Links Linn news release LinnCo will then transfer Berry’s assets to Linn in exchange for additional ownership units in its sibling, which is structured as a master limited partnership. Including the assumption of debt, the deal is valued at $4.3 billion. By purchasing Berry, Linn will significantly bolster its oil production and increase its holdings in California and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The company estimates that its newest acquisition will increase its proven reserves by 34 percent and its production capabilities by 30 percent. And Berry’s reserves are estimated to be about 75 percent oil and liquids, considered to be significantly more valuable than natural gas, given current prices. Linn cited the growth promised by the deal in announcing an increase in its quarterly distributions to unit holders, to 77 cents a unit from 72.5 cents. “Berry’s assets are an excellent fit for Linn, and we believe this transaction generates significant accretion to our distributable cash flow per unit,” Mark E. Ellis, Linn’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We have great respect for what the Berry management team has accomplished and consider the Berry employees to be an important part of this transaction.” To help defray the tax consequences LinnCo will take on in the deal, Linn will pay its affiliate $6 million a year through 2015. LinnCo was advised by Citigroup, while a conflicts committee of its board was advised by Evercore Partners and the law firm Locke Lord. A conflicts committee of Linn’s board was advised by Greenhill and Company and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld. Latham and Watkins served as legal counsel to both Linn and LinnCo.

		<content>Sovereign Credit Concerns, Low Interest Rates Reshaping World Reserves - NYTimes.com LONDON (Reuters) - After years of being also-rans, currencies from countries such as Canada, Australia, China, Brazil, Russia and Norway now have a realistic chance of breaking deeper into the $11 trillion global reserve mix. Such a move, if it came, could encourage billions of dollars in private investment to ride along in the slipstream. Deteriorating sovereign credit quality across industrial economies has already begun to push central bank asset managers to diversify away from the traditionally dominant U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, The latest IMF report - the only official data on how reserves are managed - showed central bank holdings of currencies such as Australian and Canadian dollars jumped 25 percent to 6.1 percent at end-2012. That's small compared with the 85 percent still held in U.S. dollars and euros. But it points to the future. Central bank reserve diversification is being driven by two things - the near zero official interest rates in the advanced world and the series of sovereign credit rating downgrades in major economies over the past year or so. The low interest rates drive up the cost in domestic currency terms of building a huge overseas cash piles. The downgrades simply mean traditional safe havens do not seem as safe as they were. The United States, France and Britain have lost triple-A endorsement from at least one credit agency. The latest hit to reserve credit quality came last Friday when ratings firm Fitch became the second agency to strip Britain of its top AAA rating. "Central bank and official holders of reserves, like everyone else, are worried about incipient inflation, (but) they are also worried about declining credit quality among sovereigns," said George Hoguet, global investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. "The commodity currencies in general have significantly better balance sheets, certainly than the euro zone. It's understandable that they would move to diversification." The annual survey of 60 central banks released this month, compiled by Royal Bank of Scotland for Central Banking Publications, showed two thirds of them are considering or would consider investing in China's yuan, while 40 percent of them said the same about investing in the Brazilian real, Danish crown and Indian rupee. Around one in three is considering or would consider Norwegian, Swedish and Danish crowns, Russian rouble and New Zealand dollar. "This (diversification) should stabilize the international monetary system by helping balance the investment flows and encourage (a) more long-term investment horizon into the new reserve currencies," one reserve manager at an Asian central bank told the survey. The desire for other currencies is driven by the imbalance in the demand and supply of safe-haven assets as well as the rising cost of holding a huge cash pile. Backed by strong export growth, emerging economies have built up shock-absorbing precautionary reserves via central bank intervention to cap local currencies. But that very financial operation generates a large "cost of carry" in the process. For example, China's central bank buys U.S. dollars to keep a lid on the yuan exchange rate in order to keep its exports competitive. In doing so, the bank sells yuan to its local banking system and then needs to sell yuan bonds to prevent the excess yuan seeping into the economy and stoking inflation. It is then losing the difference between what it earns on its accumulated U.S. dollars - typically held in Treasury debt - and what it pays to its banks via the yuan-denominated bonds. Tufts University researchers estimate this cost has grown to 3 percent of gross domestic product. For all emerging economies, it has grown to 1.8 percent of GDP from 1 percent in 2004. Another study by Gioia Cellai and Francesco Potente at the Bank of Italy for Central Baking Publications showed the scale of a shrinking supply of top-rated debt. rates below 100 basis points - one of the "safety" thresholds used - fell by a third to 4.7 trillion in the three years to 2011. That represents less than 50 percent of total outstanding debt, compared with more than 90 percent in 2008. At a global level, the weight of debt deemed as a safe haven against the total debt fell by more than 15 percent in the same period. "One desirable scenario for the coming years could be a gradual reduction in the concentration and polarization of the safe asset universe...(That) would require prudent fiscal policies, major regulatory changes and a deepening in the local sovereign bond markets," Cellai and Potente wrote. "The increased creditworthiness and liquidity may lead investors to gradually recognize the suitability of such bonds for meeting their safety needs, thus contributing to an increase in supply."</content>

		<content>Cautious Day Pulls S.andamp - P. From Its 5-Year High - NYTimes.com Investors started the week cautiously on Monday, pulling the Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index down from the five-year high it reached Friday. The decline occurred after traders appeared to be cashing in on some gains from the stock market surge last week, said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at SandP Capital IQ. Investors are also preparing for the latest corporate earnings reports, which will begin Tuesday, Mr. Stovall said. “You can summarize it as profit taking and preparation,” he said. “Investors are digesting some of those gains from last week and positioning themselves so they’re not too far extended if fourth-quarter earnings slip a bit.” The Dow Jones industrial average lost 50.92 points, or 0.4 percent, to 13,384.29, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 2.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 3,098.81. The S.and P. 500 gained 4.6 percent last week after the government reported that hiring held up in December during the budget negotiations in Washington, with employers adding 155,000 jobs. Investors started the year encouraged after lawmakers ended an impasse to pass a bill to avoid automatic government spending cuts and tax increases. The law passed on New Year’s Day avoided the full force of the budget cuts, which could have dragged the economy into a recession. Investors are now focusing on corporate profits. Alcoa, the leading aluminum producer, will start the earnings season for the fourth quarter of 2012 after the market closes on Tuesday. Analysts forecast that companies in the S.and P. 500 will report that quarterly earnings increased 3.3 percent compared with a year earlier, according to SandP Capital IQ. But the events of the last three months of 2012, including , the presidential election and worries about the narrowly avoided fiscal impasse, could make for surprises. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and others banks agreed to pay $8.5 billion to settle federal complaints that they had foreclosed on people who should have been allowed to stay in their homes. Bank stocks ended the day little changed. In a separate agreement, Bank of America settled with Fannie Mae, the government-owned mortgage finance company, over mortgage investments that lost value during the real estate crash. Bank of America shares fell 2 cents, or 0.2 percent to $12.09. Archer Daniels Midland, the crop-processing company, dropped 4 percent to $28.01. Analysts at JP Morgan Chase said the continuing drought in the Midwest would most likely squeeze the company’s profit margins. Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, fell 82 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $34.76 after the money-management firm Canaccord cut its rating on Lowe’s to sell from hold, saying that efforts to improve stores and sales would not be successful. Stock in the drugstore chain Walgreen Company gained 85 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $38.03 after a Jefferies and Company analyst. Scott A. Mushkin, raised his rating on the company to buy from hold, saying its profits could benefit from flu season, In the bond market, the price of the 10-year Treasury note ended unchanged from Friday at 97 17/32, and its yield was also unchanged at 1.90 percent.

		<content>Ads Hope to Ignite a Fine ‘Roadmance’ - NYTimes.com commercial, in keeping with the “Roadmance” idea, features two young men in a vintage convertible taking a drive along SH 130. One of the SH 130 air fresheners dangles from the rearview mirror. As “Clair de Lune” comes on the radio, one man says, “Shhh, this is our song,” to which the other replies, “Oh, no, not again.” The first one, waxing rhapsodic, says: “Look, I used to spend hours in traffic, but now I arrive to meetings refreshed. This new road, there’s no congestion. I just get on and go. She’s so beautiful.” The second man says, “Whoa, this is the real deal, huh?” as he points to his companion’s arm, which bears a tattoo of the heart-shaped logo. The announcer at the end repeats the “better way” lines. There is also a radio commercial in which a woman reads a poem titled “Ode to My Road,” with lines like “Your strong shoulder supports me” and “You move me ever forward.” The insight that shapes the campaign is that people “love their cars, but people hate traffic,” says Mary Pat Mueller, president of Door Number 3. “They love the open road,” she adds, but they hate the “frustration of sitting in traffic and being stressed when they get to where they’re going.” That “yearning for the open road” is a nostalgic kind of feeling, Ms. Mueller says, so the commercials have a nostalgic flavor in their art direction to suggest how “you get in the car and the wind’s in your hair and you can smell fresh air.” The “positioning” for SH 130 in the campaign is that “you’ll make better time,” Ms. Mueller says, which has a double meaning: “It’s not necessarily a promise it’ll get you there faster, but when you get there you won’t be stressed.” There was also a decision made to keep the campaign positive, Ms. Mueller says, rather than really hammer I-35 for its problems. “We didn’t want to go negative,” she adds, citing a “phenomenal” response to a “very positive” campaign the agency created for the Austin Humane Society. “People are drawn to positive energy,” Ms. Mueller says, so the campaign “talks about these issues in a fun way,” giving as an example the “No indecent gestures?” remarks by the girl in the storytelling spot. “We’re having fun,” she adds, “but we’re still pointing out the factors on the other stretch of highway.” Although there can be “a narrow line” between funny and not so funny in ads, Ms. Mueller acknowledges, humor remains “our preferred method of connecting with consumers” because it can make the ads more memorable, discourage people from tuning out, generate buzz and encourage conversations. “You have to be a little different” in “building a relationship with this highway,” she says. “It can’t be just straight directional, ‘Save time and money.’ ” That also helps explains the air fresheners. About 50,000 were distributed through direct mail as gifts to people who live in the right of way of the new sections of SH 130, Ms. Mueller says, a kind of “thanks for hanging in there during construction.” Ms. Pifer calls the air fresheners “a great little giveaway” that can help build brand recognition for the highway. She adds: “We’re having bumper stickers made that say, ‘Can you love a road?’ and temporary tattoos.” The next stage of the campaign, Ms. Pifer says, will be ads that are “geared a little more toward the trucking community,” to encourage truckers to take SH 130 rather than I-35.

		<content>Trying to Burnish Its Image, Johnson andamp - Johnson Turns to Emotions - NYTimes.com The company’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit recalled more than 280 million packages of over the counter medications like Motrin, children’s Tylenol liquid and Benadryl in 2010, and the same year, its DePuy Orthopedics unit recalled two popular artificial hip replacement models. About 10,000 lawsuits have been filed involving those artificial hip devices and while a Chicago jury this month by Johnson and Johnson in one suit, another lawsuit in March yielded a less favorable outcome when a Los Angeles jury In the midst of that turmoil — and perhaps to distance itself from the bad press of product recalls and pending litigation — the company on Thursday is introducing its first corporate branding campaign in more than 10 years. The company will announce the campaign, called For All You Love, at its annual shareholder meeting in New Brunswick, N.J. The cornerstone of the campaign, a 60-second black and white video, begins with a shot of a sleeping baby about to get a gentle kiss from its mother. In the background, a softer, almost childlike version of the Guns N’ Roses song, “Sweet Child O’ Mine” plays. “Love,” says a woman’s voice. “It’s the most powerful thing on the planet.” Happy clips from everyday life — a father bathing with his baby, a grandfather playing piano with his granddaughter and a teacher playing with her students — are seen during the spot, as is the occasional Johnson and Johnson product like Band-Aids and baby shampoo. The campaign was created by TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of TBWA Worldwide, a division of the Omnicom Group. It is the first time the agency has worked with Johnson and Johnson. “This is the chance to reassert this very iconic brand to the world,” said Rob Schwartz, the global creative president of TBWA Worldwide. The creative team at the agency was inspired by a company statement produced in 1943 that highlighted its responsibility to its consumers, employees, communities and stockholders. Mr. Schwartz described the statement as “one of the best corporate documents ever.” Based on that, the agency created a manifesto about love that will appear in print publications, including The New York Times and People magazine on May 10. Television commercials and digital ads will begin appearing on May 6 during shows like “Modern Family” on ABC, “The Voice” on NBC and “American Idol” on Fox, and on Web sites like . The videos feature real people and real relationships, not actors, Mr. Schwartz said. Subsequent videos for the campaign will also focus on the philanthropic work the company supports. The campaign is estimated to cost $20 million to $30 million through the end of the year. While a Johnson and Johnson spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s recalls or the lawsuits it faces, Michael Sneed, the company’s vice president for global corporate affairs, said the goal of the campaign was “to continue to reconnect with all of the people who come into contact with J.and J. in their daily lives.” A campaign focused on love creates a sense of trust with the brand, said Kapil Bawa, a marketing professor at the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York. “Corporate branding tries to instill a sense of trust in the company and for J.and J., given the kind of products it makes, that trust is very, very critical,” Mr. Bawa said. Mr. Sneed agreed. “I do think people want to understand what’s behind the brand,” he said. “They want to understand what they value.” about a forensic sketch artist drawing women based on their own descriptions. “They are trying to humanize the corporate entity,” Mr. Bawa said. “That’s why emotion is so important.” Emotion was also present at the ad agency table, Mr. Schwartz said. “The smell of the baby powder, the scent of the shampoo, everybody got very emotional just from our meetings,” he said. “This is a very emotional brand, so we’ve got to deliver a very emotional idea.”</content>

		<content>Dell Products Make Their Way, Circuitously, to Syria - NYTimes.com have been sold to the Syrian government through a Dubai-based distributor despite strict trade sanctions intended to ban the selling of technology to the regime, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. The disclosure of the computer sales is the latest example of how the Syrian government has managed to acquire technology, some of which is used to censor Internet activity and track opponents of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. According to internal company e-mails, cash transfer statements, sales receipts and shipping documents, the computer equipment was sold by BDL Gulf, which is based in Saudi Arabia and is a large distributor of computer equipment in the Middle East. It is an authorized dealer for Dell in the Middle East and Africa, and is also a reseller for other computer brands, including Samsung and Acer. BDL sold the equipment to Anas Hasoon Trading, a Damascus-based company with contracts to provide computers to the Syrian government, according to billings records and e-mail exchanges between the companies. Jess Blackburn, a spokesman for Dell in Round Rock, Tex., confirmed that BDL was an authorized reseller. He said the company was recently made aware of a possible shipment of Dell equipment to “We are investigating an allegation we received recently that BDL was involved in a possible transaction involving Syria,” Mr. Blackburn said in a statement. “Dell requires its resellers to follow U.S. trade requirements, just as Dell does. Resellers of Dell products and services are contractually prohibited from selling or shipping any technology to a customer in a restricted country.” The United States has barred the sales of most American-made goods to Syria for nearly a decade and has repeatedly tightened sanctions against the government. An executive order by President Obama, dated April 22, 2012, specifically addresses the sale of computer technology to Syria, barring Americans from helping the Iranian and Syrian governments engage in human rights abuses, including monitoring and tracking of dissidents. United States officials charged with enforcing sanctions against Syria would not comment on the possible violation of export sanction laws but did say that exporting technology to Syria was illegal unless the sale would promote the free flow of information between the Syrian people and the outside world. Asked about the evidence of shipments to Syria, a manager at BDL said the company had hundreds of customers and did not keep track of their locations. “We cannot know if they are from Pakistan, Egypt or Morocco; we just sell in Dubai,” said RamaNarayan Singh, who is listed as BDL’s sales manager for the United Arab Emirates, Africa and Iran. “I’m just an employee doing my duty. I don’t know if a company is from Syria.” But e-mails between Mr. Singh and a representative from Anas Hasoon Trading show that the Syrian company made it clear to him that it was working on behalf of the Assad government. Mr. Singh signed several invoices that listed a Syrian address for the trading company. Mr. Singh said he did not recall the e-mails or the invoices. The records, which were provided to The Times by an individual who was briefed on the transactions, showed that BDL sold hundreds of laptops, tablets and desktop computers to the Syrian company. In e-mails sent between Mr. Singh and Yahya Rifai, who was listed as a purchasing manager for the Anas Hasoon Trading company, Mr. Rifai mentioned several times that he was working to buy the computers for the Syrian government. The companies dealt mainly in cash, records showed, after transfers from Syrian banks to banks in Dubai were rejected because of financial sanctions against the country. In an e-mail to Mr. Singh dated Sept. 2, 2012, Mr. Rifai wrote about his difficulties in using bank transfers to pay for the computers because of the sanctions. “Dear Ram, my problem is how to get money from Syria to you? As you know I’m working on tenders deals with the government which required many documents and approvals!!” he wrote. Barred by banks from making electronic transfers, Mr. Rifai made several large cash deposits into the bank account of BDL to purchase the computers, the documents show. Asked last month about the purchases, Mr. Rifai responded in an e-mail: “We are Syrian company so we don’t care about the rules America put, its only for American companies not us.” Last year, the Syrian government made similar purchases of computer equipment from a reseller of Hewlett-Packard. The equipment, according to various news reports, was used to monitor the e-mail and Internet use of opposition forces. Hewlett-Packard said its computers were sold without its knowledge. In 2011, Internet-blocking devices from Blue Coat Systems, of Sunnyvale, Calif., were shipped to Syria from Dubai. Blue Coat thinks the gear was sold to the Iraqi government. “It’s a pattern that we’ve seen across the Middle East from governments trying to avoid democratic changes — using proxies to bypass sanctions and buy equipment to stifle dissent and track Internet activity,” said Charles Dunne, a former National Security Council official and director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Freedom House, a Washington nonprofit group that promotes democratic change. “The U.S. government and companies need to do a better job of making sure this equipment does not end up in the hands of governments like the Assad regime.” An earlier version of this article and an accompanying picture erroneously identified Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia as the owner of BDL Gulf. Representatives of Prince Alwaleed said that neither he nor his senior advisers are aware of any connection between the prince and BDL Gulf.</content>

		<content>Are These Ads Worth the Paper They’re Not Printed On? - NYTimes.com A campaign to promote the value of using paper is turning to everyday situations to make its point after spending more than two years at the office. .” The humorous videos are billed as entries in a series of “Really, Really Short Films” that started with the introduction of the campaign, which is aimed at so-called thought leaders in fields like business and education, in September 2010. The first batch of videos, as well as the second, released in December 2011, offered viewers wacky vignettes that occurred at a workplace where a crusade to go “paperless” was carried to extremes. For instance, in one video, titled an office worker begs her colleague for “more of that stuff you got me last week,” which turns out to be 20 sheets of paper. The new videos, by contrast, are meant to demonstrate the importance of paper outside office settings. Two take place in homes and two in restaurants. The plots seem familiar at first, but then take twists meant to underscore why paper still has value. The videos are in addition to other elements of the “Paper because” campaign, which include, of course, print advertisements. Those ads make “Paper because” points like “print is an art form,” “learning something new deserves all your attention,” “all this social media might be making us less social” and “a lot of places worth going to don’t get a signal, and hopefully never will.” Estimates are that spending for the campaign by Domtar, which is based in Montreal and has its operations center in Fort Mill, S.C., has totaled more than $10 million. The campaign is indicative of how marketers and agencies handle important questions about campaigns that run for a while with the same theme. How long should the ads run as they are? When is the time to make changes? One problem is that the ads may continue past the point that consumers grow tired of them, diminishing their effectiveness. But the ads could also be changed before consumers have really noticed them or had time to absorb the pitch being made because the people involved in developing and producing them have had their fill. “When you work on a project, sometimes you’re tired of it before it goes out,” says Kathy Wholley, director for advertising and communications at Domtar, who is based in Fort Mill. It is important to remember that “this campaign is still reaching people for the first time,” she adds, noting messages on Twitter that say something like this: “‘Look what I just found. This video is hilarious.’ ” Still, taking a fresh look at a continuing campaign makes sense, Ms. Wholley says, as in this instance, when a thought emerged about how “there are times and places” outside the office world “where paper is appropriate and useful.” “We could continue to put out the silly” videos about the perils and pitfalls of the paperless office, she adds, “but we thought we made our point on that.” a couple is seated at a table in a restaurant. “Happy anniversary,” the wife tells the husband. “I brought you something.” She hands him a card. “Oh, honey, you’re so thoughtful,” the husband says. “It’s perfect. Thank you.” He then changes the subject: “You ready to order? I’m starving.” The wife, puzzled, asks, “Honey? You didn’t get me a card?” He replies, “Of course I did. You didn’t get it? I sent you an e-card.” The wife responds, “An e-card?” At that point, the scene fades to black. The sounds effects in the dark suggest the wife is leaving the table, and the restaurant. The husband’s plaintive voice is heard, “Honey? Where are you going? Did you check your spam filter? Did you?” also takes place in a restaurant. Men and women are ordering meals, but the waiter has no pad, pen or pencil. “Shouldn’t you be writing those down?” one of his customers asks.</content>

		<content>Dealing With the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act - NYTimes.com Paul Hilton/European Pressphoto AgencyLas Vegas Sands opened the Venetian Macau resort casino in 2007. The pressure is only increasing on companies that get caught up in bribery cases, making it unlikely that efforts to soften United States laws will occur anytime soon. Despite overtures from the United States Chamber of Commerce and other business organizations for a more lenient approach to the application of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission continue to aggressively pursue investigations of bribery abroad. Information made public last week about two prominent investigations are more evidence of how mindful companies need to be about the law, which has taken on new relevance for global business. White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools The Las Vegas Sands Corporation disclosed Friday that its internal investigation into dealings related to its casino properties in Macau showed “that there were likely violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions” of the act. It tried to soften the blow by noting “that in recent years, the company has improved its practices with respect to books and records and internal controls,” but that does not insulate the company from potential criminal and civil penalties for violations. In addition, the Kimco Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust specializing in shopping centers, disclosed on Wednesday that it received a subpoena from the S.E.C. as part of the investigation into foreign bribery by Wal-Mart in its Mexican subsidiary and elsewhere. That investigation came about after extensive reporting in The New York Times related to bribes paid to officials to gain approval to build stores in Mexico. Wal-Mart has already spent more than $100 million conducting a global review of its operations. It is not clear how Kimco might be involved, but the latest subpoena is a signal of a potentially widened investigation on the part of government officials. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases were a centerpiece of the term of the former assistant attorney general, Lanny A. Breuer, who until Friday had led the Justice Department’s criminal division. His return to private practice is unlikely to have changed the focus on foreign bribery. As the corruption investigations have ramped up, the United States Chamber of Commerce has pushed back against the law by arguing that it hampers American businesses because of how broadly it can be applied. Recent cases against pharmaceutical companies, like Pfizer for payments to foreign doctors who are part of state-controlled health systems show how the law can be used in areas once thought to fall outside its purview. In response to criticisms about how the law was being applied, the Justice Department and S.E.C. issued a resource guide last November that outlines their views about the scope of the law. Companies hoped that the guidance would take a more restrictive view of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by providing clearer guideposts on when the statute does — and more important does not — apply to a transaction. Unfortunately, the government did not provide the kind of definitive guidance that companies sought. In a previous article, I noted that business organizations like the Chamber of Commerce would probably undertake a “reinvigorated effort to change the statute and provide brighter lines for companies doing business abroad.” That effort arrived with a letter to the Justice Department and the S.E.C. dated Feb. 19 on behalf of more than 30 business organizations. In it, the business lobbying group reiterated many of its criticisms of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and suggested changes to the law and guidance. The letter recommended amending the statute to give a “compliance defense” to insulate from harm a company whose employees engaged in foreign bribery to by circumventing internal measures intended to prevent such misconduct. This is the same proposal offered in 2011 by a former attorney general, Michael B. Mukasey, on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce, an effort that was stymied by the revelations in The New York Times about Wal-Mart’s Mexican bribery. A compliance defense may not truly protect a company against criminal charges. As I wrote in a recent article published in The Ohio State Law Journal, prosecutors may engage in an even broader investigation of a company’s practices if there is a concern about countering such a defense, which could be even more intrusive than current inquiries that are limited to just the foreign bribery. The Chamber of Commerce also complained about the lack of concrete guidance on who is a “foreign official” and what is an “instrumentality” of the government. While other parts of the resource guide give examples of the types of conduct that comes within the statute, the section dealing with these terms is much shorter and contains no examples. The letter states that this perpetuates “uncertainty in the business community regarding the meaning of these terms and make it more difficult for businesses to determine when they are interacting with ‘foreign officials.’” American businesses continue to express frustration with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, but more countries are adopting or expanding their antibribery laws to follow the United States model. For example, a bill introduced in February in the Senate of Canada would expand the foreign bribery law to reach conduct by any Canadian company or citizen throughout the world, and establish that it is a violation to make false entries in corporate accounting records to cover up illicit payments. These provisions are almost identical to the United States law. Whether American companies will be able to gain much traction in Congress to revise the foreign bribery statute remains questionable. Apart from the various budget battles on Capitol Hill that will be a top priority, there is the issue about what message revising the law would send if Congress gives companies greater leeway to avoid punishment for corrupt payments by employees.

Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School, is the author of “The Prosecution and Defense of Public Corruption: The Law and Legal Strategies.” Twitter: @peterjhenning</content>

		<content>U.S. May Charge JPMorgan for Power Market Manipulation - Analysts - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - The regulator of U.S. power markets appears likely to pursue manipulation charges against JPMorgan Chase and Co, analysts said, after a New York Times report on the agency's document that seemed to lay out its case. The Times said on Friday it reviewed a confidential, 70-page government document that the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) sent to JPMorgan in March, which alleged the bank manipulated the power market in California and Michigan in 2010 and 2011. FERC investigators found JPMorgan devised "manipulative schemes" that transformed "money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers," the Times reported, citing the document. It said the bank has until mid-May to respond. It has been clear since last summer that FERC was pursuing a deep enquiry on JPMorgan's trading activities, the latest in a string of FERC investigations that have rattled the U.S. power market and - in the case of rival bank Barclays Plc - concluded with $470 million in proposed penalties. "FERC staff would not have gone to the trouble of putting together a 70-page document without a case. If they have gotten this far they will likely pursue it," said Susan Court, a former senior lawyer at FERC who is principal of SJC Energy Consultants LLC in Arlington, Virginia. The document also criticized Blythe Masters, JPMorgan's head of global commodities and former chief financial officer, saying she "falsely" denied under oath that she was aware of schemes carried out by a group of energy traders in Houston, according to the Times. "We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter," JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli said. "We intend to vigorously defend the firm and the employees in this matter." The document cited by the Times came after a months-long inquiry into the bank's trading in power markets, one of several high-profile investigations since FERC's enforcement powers were expanded in 2005 following the Enron scandal a decade ago. "We cannot, and do not, speculate as to any investigations, as they are all non-public. We do not speculate as to whether investigations are taking place, nor do we speculate as to whether or when the Commission will take any action," FERC spokeswoman Mary O'Driscoll said. FERC last summer subpoenaed JPMorgan to produce 25 internal emails - some between Blythe Masters and the bank's head of principal commodity investments Francis Dunleavy - as part an ongoing investigation focused on bidding practices that may have raised electricity prices by about $73 million in California and the Midwest power markets. FERC normally does not disclose investigations but chose to subpoena JPMorgan after the bank claimed the emails were protected by attorney client privilege. A federal magistrate in November sided with JPMorgan and ruled that FERC could not see the emails. FERC appealed that decision in January. In November, FERC imposed a temporary ban on JPMorgan's ability to trade physical power at market-based rates for six months, starting in April, for failing to disclose information to the FERC and the California ISO in a market manipulation investigation. In December, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the trading ban is "not that big a deal" for the bank. FERC Commissioner Cheryl LaFleur dissented in that November vote, saying the agency should include penalties for any failure to disclose information as part of the market manipulation case if the agency decided to pursue it. In order to pursue a penalty or disgorgement of profits, FERC staff typically issues a public show-cause order, which has not yet occurred in the JPMorgan case. "A lot of the letters that FERC sends out are trying to get at facts. And the tone of this (letter) sounds a little different ... a little bit more sharp," said Marc Spitzer, a partner at the law firm of Steptoe and Johnson in Washington, and a former FERC Commissioner. One open question at this point is to what extent FERC's cases may be weakened by a ruling in March on a case related to Brian Hunter, a trader for the now closed Amaranth Advisors hedge fund, who was fined $30 million by FERC for alleged manipulation of gas prices in 2006. A federal appeals court ruled that FERC acted outside of its mandate in imposing the fine because the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has jurisdiction over financial derivatives trading. FERC has jurisdiction over physical power and natural gas trading, but several of its recent cases - including the one against Barclays - hinge on demonstrating that traders may have manipulated physical prices in order to profit on derivatives. Barclays has disputed the FERC allegations and said it will defend itself in court if FERC issues a final order seeking to impose the fine. To date, FERC has not issued a final order. "We need more information about the JPMorgan and Barclays cases to know whether there are Hunter questions. I am confident law firms with manipulation cases at FERC are pursuing that question," Court, of SJC Energy Consultants, said.

		<content>American Car Parts Makers Gain in Russia - NYTimes.com MOSCOW — Critics of the Obama administration’s thawed diplomatic policy toward Russia, known as the “reset,” say it has brought few concrete results. But this week, a visiting American trade delegation is promoting an economic benefit — a doubling of exports of American car parts to Russia over the past year. The increase in sales is striking even compared with an overall rise in American exports to Russia, which the Commerce Department says were up about 40 percent last year, partly owing to trade rebounding after the Aerospace and software companies are also doing well. Proponents of the reset point to the recent multibillion-dollar joint venture between Exxon Mobil, America’s largest oil company, and Russia’s state oil company, Rosneft, as another economic payoff of the policy. Most American auto parts exported to Russia are put in new cars at assembly plants set up earlier by Ford, General Motors or European or Japanese competitors. But aftermarket sales are also rising. Reflecting the significant accomplishment of makers of gaskets, fenders and headlights, a deputy under secretary of commerce for international trade, Michelle O’Neill, led the delegation of 13 car parts companies to the Russian capital and two manufacturing regions. “Russians love American cars,” Ms. O’Neill said. “We think there is extraordinary opportunity for growth.” Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization, expected this summer with American support, will require that Russia phase out local content rules for automotive assembly plants, further expanding the potential market. However, Congress must first grant Russia permanent normal trade relation status by repealing a cold war-era statute intended to liberalize emigration of religious minorities, the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, before American companies can take full advantage of the new rules. Economists have noted for years that Russia and the United States have relatively little direct trade compared with the size of their economies — a legacy of the superpower standoff and politics today. To improve economic ties as part of the reset that President Obama introduced in 2009, the Commerce Department established a committee on trade with Russia. Members identified car parts as a prospective market and worked to eliminate barriers to United States exports. “It has been a focused effort by the Obama administration to deepen commercial and economic relations,” Ms. O’Neill said in an interview in Moscow on Monday. “This is one of the fruits of that labor.” The Commerce Department said auto parts sales rose to $125.3 million in 2011 from $63.3 million in 2010. Matthew Edwards, the department’s director of the office for trade with Russia and other former Soviet states, said mundane trade in items like car parts often goes unnoticed. “Everybody likes to roll out an airliner,” he said. “But a lot of trade takes place on a less sexy level.” The Hoosier Gasket Corporation, of Indianapolis, is one company poised to sell more parts to Russia. As major manufacturers outsource more components while also assembling vehicles overseas, exports rise for parts makers. “It’s a domino effect,” Oleg Gostomelsky, a vice president at Hoosier, who was on the delegation, said. “Now, when Ford decides to come to Russia, as it has, it pulls a lot of companies with it.” Critics of the reset policy, though, say it has deflected attention from more fundamental American interests by playing down human rights abuse and backsliding on democracy in Russia under Vladimir V. Putin, who is set to begin a third presidential term in May. Last month, after Mr. Obama inadvertently spoke into an open microphone while discussing missile defense policy with Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney characterized Russia as “without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.” As it happens, car parts manufacturers are heavily represented in swing states like Ohio and Indiana, one explanation, perhaps, for careful attention to their industry. The delegation included representatives of Dana Holding of Maumee, Ohio; Bushwacker of Portland, Ore.; and Cyclo Industries of Jupiter, Fla.</content>

		<content>Icahn Says Yahoo 'Completely Botched' Microsoft Talks - NYTimes.com Article Tools Carl Icahn rarely minces words, and his blunt talk was on full display Thursday in a letter to the chairman of Yahoo‘s board, Roy Bostock. In the letter, Mr. Icahn formally announced his intention to seek the ouster of the Web giant’s board unless it moved quickly to restart talks to be acquired by Microsoft. Mr. Icahn, a billionaire investor with a taste for shaking things up at big companies, called the current board’s behavior “irresponsible” and “unconscionable” and said he thought it “completely botched” the merger negotiations, which Microsoft recently broke off. Below, the full text of Mr. Icahn’s letter: Carl C. Icahn ICAHN CAPITAL LP 767 Fifth Avenue, 47th Floor New York, NY 10153 May 15, 2008 Roy Bostock Chairman Yahoo! Inc. 701 First Avenue Sunnyvale, CA 94089 Dear Mr. Bostock: It is clear to me that the board of directors of Yahoo has acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders and Microsoft. It is quite obvious that Microsoft’s bid of $33 per share is a superior alternative to Yahoo’s prospects on a standalone basis. I am perplexed by the board’s actions. It is irresponsible to hide behind management’s more than overly optimistic financial forecasts. It is unconscionable that you have not allowed your shareholders to choose to accept an offer that represented a 72% premium over Yahoo’s closing price of $19.18 on the day before the initial Microsoft offer. I and many of your shareholders strongly believe that a combination between Yahoo and Microsoft would form a dynamic company and more importantly would be a force strong enough to compete with Google on the Internet. During the past week, a number of shareholders have asked me to lead a proxy fight to attempt to remove the current board and to establish a new board which would attempt to negotiate a successful merger with Microsoft, something that in my opinion the current board has completely botched. I believe that a combination between Microsoft and Yahoo is by far the most sensible path for both companies. I have therefore taken the following actions: (1) during the last 10 days, I have purchased approximately 59 million shares and share-equivalents of Yahoo; (2) I have formed a 10-person slate which will stand for election against the current board; and (3) I have sought antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to acquire up to approximately $2.5 billion worth of Yahoo stock. The biographies of the members of our slate are attached to this letter. A more formal notification is being delivered today to Yahoo under separate cover. While it is my understanding that you do not intend to enter into any transaction that would impede a Microsoft-Yahoo merger, I am concerned that in several recent press releases you stated that you intend to pursue certain “strategic alternatives”. I therefore hope and trust that if there is any question that these “strategic alternatives” might in any way impede a future Microsoft merger you will at the very least allow shareholders to opine on them before embarking on such a transaction. I sincerely hope you heed the wishes of your shareholders and move expeditiously to negotiate a merger with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary. Sincerely yours, CARL C.

		<content>War at Wynn Opens a Legal Can of Worms - NYTimes.com Jerome Favre/Bloomberg NewsThe Wynn Macau in China. What the Deal Professor described as an “all-out war” between Wynn Resorts and Kazuo Okada, the Japanese pachinko machine magnate who has been ousted as a director and shareholder, is not just a boardroom battle over control of the company. Wynn’s accusations that Mr. Okada may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act means the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission will be scouring the company’s books for possible violations, a front that neither side can control. By invoking the specter of overseas bribery, Wynn has effectively opened itself up to a wide-ranging federal investigation of its dealings in Macao and elsewhere. Combined with the lawsuit it filed against Mr. Okada, the company most likely will face soaring legal costs over the next year or two as it deals with the fallout from the dispute. White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools Mr. Okada owned 19.66 percent of Wynn until the company forcibly moved to redeem his shares at a 30 percent discount earlier this month because of its determination that he did not meet the “suitability” requirement for an investor in a Nevada casino. Wynn released a report prepared by Louis J. Freeh, a former F.B.I. director, and his law firm asserting there was evidence Mr. Okada engaged in “prima facie violations” of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a conclusion he strongly disagrees with. The report describes $110,000 in benefits purportedly provided by Mr. Okada to Philippine casino regulators and potential benefits of about $5,000 to South Korean officials. Mr. Okada has been seeking to build a $2 billion casino complex in the Philippines, but had been rebuffed in his attempt to get Wynn to participate in the project. The growing dispute between Mr. Okada and Wynn marked the end of the once-close relationship he had with Stephen A. Wynn, the billionaire who controls the company. Romeo Ranoco/ReutersKazuo Okada, chairman of Universal Entertainment. The first salvo in the battle between Mr. Okada and Wynn was fired in January, when he sued the company to gain access to records relating to its $135 million donation to the University of Macao, where the company has a large casino. Wynn disclosed that the S.E.C. had asked the company to preserve its records related to the donation as part of an informal inquiry. An initial issue that investigators will have to determine is whether these transactions violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. While it is described as a bribery statute, the act also covers gifts given for the purpose of influencing in any way the acts or decisions of a foreign official, so a charitable donation could result in a violation. Wynn’s donation does not fit the usual pattern for a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, however, because it was a highly public gift, including a ceremony attended by, among others, Mr. Okada. Investigators will look at the reasons for the donation, and whether it was made as a result of any pressure from public officials in Macao. It is not a defense to a charge that the payment was made in response to requests by a local government. The information about the benefits that Mr. Okada is accused of providing raise a different question regarding the applicability of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Under the law, a company that issues securities in the United States, or any citizen or resident of this country, comes within the prohibition on overseas bribery. A third category in the statute reaches payments made by any person “while in the territory of the United States,” so that transactions that involve an American subsidiary or transfers through a United States financial institution could be covered by the law. Mr. Freeh’s report describes benefits provided to Philippine casino regulators for “high-roller” rooms at Wynn Resorts Macao and other expenses that were paid through a “ledger account” that Mr. Okada maintained with the company, paid for by him and created “for billing conveniences related to charges incurred at various Wynn Resorts locales.” Whether there is any direct tie between benefits that Mr. Okada provided abroad and conduct in the United States is unclear. He has a Nevada-based company through which he owned his Wynn shares before their redemption, and it also has an equity interest in the Philippine gambling operation. None of the benefits were provided at Wynn’s Nevada properties. The only apparent connection to the United States is Mr. Okada’s use of his Wynn “ledger account” to pay for the rooms and expenses, which resulted in entries on the company’s records in the United States. But this does not appear to have involved any misuse of corporate assets, only funds provided by Mr. Okada that were maintained with the company, almost like a personal account in which Wynn acted as the bookkeeper. Even if these transactions did not violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, federal investigators are unlikely to limit themselves to just the University of Macao donation and Mr. Okada’s dealings with Philippine casino regulators. For example, the Las Vegas Sands Corporation has disclosed that the S.E.C. and Justice Department are investigating whether it violated the act related to its Macao casino, and there is a possibility that Wynn’s operation there will be subjected to similar scrutiny. Once an investigation is opened, it takes on a life of its own and can go in any direction, so Wynn should be prepared to deal with the S.E.C. and Justice Department for quite a while. Legal fees for the company and its directors in this type of investigation can grow quickly, as Avon has learned as it disclosed spending $95 million in 2010 dealing with a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation that has been going on since 2008. Wynn will also see burgeoning legal costs from its lawsuit against Mr. Okada, filed in Nevada state court, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and other violations. He is sure to litigate his removal from the company’s board and the redemption of his shares at a substantial discount to the current market price. Not only does Wynn have to pay its own lawyers, but it may have to pay for Mr. Okada’s legal counsel in defending against the company’s lawsuit. Wynn’s articles of incorporation are typical of publicly traded companies by providing for indemnification of legal fees resulting from litigation related to a director’s conduct. By accusing him of breaching his fiduciary duty as a director, the company may be on the hook for any costs in defending against its lawsuit. In addition, the indemnification provision covers government investigations, so to the extent the S.E.C. and Justice Department scrutinize Mr. Okada for his actions as a director of Wynn, the company may be responsible for paying those legal fees as well. The indemnification provision has an interesting limitation that does not require the company to pay legal fees for any actions related to a person’s “capacity as a stockholder, including, but not limited to, in connection with such person being deemed an unsuitable person.” Wynn could try to avoid paying Mr. Okada’s lawyers by claiming that the cases relate to his suitability as an investor in a Nevada casino. Whether that argument can succeed remains to be seen, and asserting this ground would generate additional litigation over the availability of indemnification – for which the company might also have to pay for his lawyers, too. For Wynn, this is only the beginning of its battles as it faces a potentially lengthy investigation by the S.E.C. and Justice Department along with protracted litigation with Mr. Okada. The company may well see its legal costs take a sizable bite out of profits over the next few quarters. Peter J.

		<content>Wall Street Prepares to Open - NYTimes.com WALL STREET PREPARES TO OPEN  |  The New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other trading platforms are set to open on Wednesday, after Hurricane Sandy forced markets to shut down for two days. Wall Street is coming back online even in the face of lingering concerns. Large swaths of the financial district in Manhattan remain underwater or without power. Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools In the aftermath of the storm, “Wall Street faces a critical test,” Susanne Craig and Ben Protess write in DealBook: “If the exchanges open before they are truly ready, the markets might be vulnerable to complications that could ripple through the financial system.” But Wall Street also wants to show it can “operate in difficult conditions.” The New York Stock Exchange spent much of Tuesday conducting trials. Earlier, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, stranded in California, held a phone conference with bank regulators to discuss potential difficulties. “Right now there are a lot of connectivity problems,” said Lawrence E. Leibowitz, the chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext. The banks are making backup plans, too. “We’re working on contingency plans right now on how to move people logistically are around the city,” the president of Goldman Sachs, Gary D. Cohn, told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. Goldman plans to open its headquarters on Wednesday, the firm said in a memorandum to staff members. JPMorgan Chase is reopening its Park Avenue headquarters in addition to at least 100 hub bank branches, but Frank J. Bisignano, the bank’s co-chief operating officer, said, “Power in New York City will be a challenge,” Nelson D. Schwartz reports in The New York Times.   DISNEY’S NEW TOY  |  The Walt Disney Company is paying $4.05 billion to acquire Lucasfilm, giving it control of the Star Wars franchise. The cash-and-stock deal, which ranks among Disney’s largest, follows the company’s usual strategy of taking over big-name franchises with the hope they will pay off down the road, DealBook’s Michael J. de la Merced writes. George Lucas, who is described as Lucasfilm’s “sole shareholder,” could see his wealth rise immensely. The Media Decoder blog writes that the deal “strengthens the legacy” of Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, who is known for aggressively expanding the company. Disney plans to release a new Star Wars movie in 2015.   FRESH LEGAL WOES FOR BARCLAYS |  Barclays is feeling the heat, again. On Wednesday, it disclosed two new investigations. American regulators are looking into whether the bank violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in its capital-raising efforts during the financial crisis, following similar inquiries by British counterparts. The United States government is also looking into the past energy trading activities of Barclays. As if that were not enough, Barclays also reported a third-quarter loss of £106 million ($170 million). That compares with a profit of £1.4 billion in the period a year earlier. “The last three months have been difficult for Barclays,” said Antony P. Jenkins, who took over as the bank’s chief executive in July during a rate-rigging scandal.   ON THE AGENDA  |  It has been one year since MF Global collapsed in bankruptcy. Regulators moved forward this month with an effort to prevent a similar failure from happening in the future.

Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. While these strategies have tax advantages, they also raise concerns. Mr. Davidoff writes: “The fact that all of this activity is for anything but retirement is a case study in how legitimate tax policies can be distorted and rules bent to benefit the inventive. More sadly, though, is that a whole industry growing around these investments also shows how some Americans are willing to risk anything for a big jackpot in the markets.”    |  Contact: @williamalden | E-mail   Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.   Mergers and Acquisitions » PVH to Buy Warnaco Group for $2.9 Billion  |  The fashion company PVH Corporation agreed on Wednesday to acquire the Warnaco Group in a $2.9 billion deal, bringing various Calvin Klein brands under one corporate umbrella.

Earlier this year, he left the firm. Will the second time be the charm for Gleacher and Company? The embattled boutique bank said on Wednesday that it was in “preliminary discussions” with an unnamed third party about a possible business combination, months after Gleacher ended merger talks with Stifel Financial. That new dance partner is Sterne Agee, another midsize investment bank, according to Bloomberg News. A spokesman for Gleacher declined to comment. A spokesman for Sterne Agee was not immediately available for comment. Gleacher has been struggling for several years, cutting costs and laying off employees in a bid to turn itself around. The announcement on Wednesday was prefaced by news that Gleacher planned to close its mortgage-backed securities, rates and credit products business, which will affect up to 160 employees. Article Tools Related Links Document: Gleacher news release But until Wednesday, Gleacher’s board appeared reluctant to pursue a sale of the firm, despite having retained Credit Suisse last year to explore potential deal options. It broke off talks with Stifel last fall, believing the offered price was too low. Eric Gleacher, the veteran mergers specialist who founded the firm and was a proponent of a sale, left earlier this year. Several weeks later, the firm announced that while it would sell its mortgage-lending arm to Ocwen Financial, it had concluded its strategic review process and found its options wanting.</content>

		<content>Customers Avoid Sprint in 1Q as Suitors Circle - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (AP) — The flow of new customers to Sprint stopped in the latest quarter, the company reported Wednesday as it weighed the offers of two corporate suitors. Sprint Nextel Corp., the country's third-largest cellphone carrier, said it added a net of just 12,000 customers to its Sprint brand in the quarter, and it would have lost 252,000 if it wasn't for Nextel customers moving over now that their network is being shut down. The number of new Sprint customers was the lowest for any quarter since 2009, and suggests that CEO Dan Hesse's carefully engineered turnaround of the company is on shaky ground. There are just 1 million Nextel customers left, raising the question of what Sprint's subscriber trends will look like when they're gone. Sprint executives acknowledged that they are losing some customers because the company is behind the other three nationwide carriers when it comes to data download speeds. It's building a high-speed "LTE" network, but in the meantime, most customers are stuck on a slow "3G" network. ATandT Inc., the second-largest phone company, posted weak subscriber numbers on Tuesday. Verizon Wireless, the industry titan, saw strong trends, as did underdog T-Mobile USA, possibly because it just started selling the iPhone. Overland Park, Kan.-based Sprint ended March with 55.2 million devices on its network, of which 31.3 million were on contract-based plans, which are the most lucrative. In the short term, having fewer new customers helps a phone company's bottom line, since it doesn't have to pay out as much in phone subsidies. Phone companies pay hundreds of dollars in subsidies to put new phones in customer hands for $199 or less. Sprint, which has posted a net loss in every quarter for the last six years, narrowed its first-quarter net loss to $643 million, or 21 cents per share. A year ago, it lost $863 million, or 29 cents per share. Both figures beat analyst estimates. According to FactSet's survey, Wall Street expected Sprint to report a loss of 32 cents per share on revenue of $8.73 billion. Sprint shares rose 2 cents to $7.12 in morning trading, suggesting that investors don't believe the latest quarterly results will change the strategies of its suitors. Sprint has agreed to sell 70 percent of itself to Japan's Softbank Corp. for $20.1 billion, but last week got a competing $25.5 billion offer from Dish Network Corp. for the whole company. A special committee of Sprint's directors is considering Dish's proposal. Hesse didn't comment further on a conference call with analysts, but said the company still assumes that it will close three deals by July 1: the sale of a stake to Softbank, the buyout of minority shareholders in network operator Clearwire Corp., and the acquisition of some Midwestern service areas from U.S. Cellular Corp.</content>

		<content>Nationwide Insurance Teams Up With ‘Mad Men’ - NYTimes.com The series is “Mad Men,” which begins its sixth season with a two-hour episode Sunday night. Nationwide Insurance has made a deal with AMC, the cable channel that is home to “Mad Men,” to become a season-long sponsor of the series, making this the first time the company has advertised on AMC. The agreement, which includes sponsorship of other AMC series like “The Walking Dead,” has an estimated value of $2 million to $2.5 million. As part of the deal, Nationwide will run during a coming episode of “Mad Men” a special commercial, styled to resemble a programming vignette. The special spot will be in addition to appearances during the show’s season of regular commercials that are part of the current campaign for Nationwide, which carry the slogan “Join the Nation” and The special commercial is to feature Matt Jauchius, chief marketing officer at Nationwide, discussing the company’s advertising history, including a memorandum found in the Nationwide archives, which contain materials that date to its founding in 1926 as the Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. The memo was written on May 13, 1964, by the Nationwide advertising agency at the time, Ogilvy, Benson and Mather, now known as Ogilvy and Mather Worldwide. The memo suggested seven possible replacements for what was then the slogan for Nationwide’s ads, “In service with people,” which, Mr. Jauchius said in a phone interview, had been in use “pretty much since the founding” of the company. The suggestions included “Nationwide is on your side,” “On your side ... Nationwide,” “Nationwide ... a friend in need from cradle to grave” and “You’d send a friend to Nationwide.” Nationwide executives chose to rework “Nationwide is on your side” into “The man from Nationwide is on your side,” Mr. Jauchius said, adding the first three words to reflect that “we distributed our products through agents” — who, in “a sign of the times,” were referred to as men. The slogan was changed to “Nationwide is on your side” in 1973, he added, when the company adopted a seven-note jingle that was heard in its commercials for decades. The memo was signed by an Ogilvy executive named Ted Shaw. Coincidentally, there has been a character on “Mad Men” since the fourth season — an agency executive who is The educated and affluent viewers who watch “Mad Men,” particularly those ages 18 to 49, “are exactly the people we want to reach,” said Mr. Jauchius, who works in Columbus, Ohio. Even more appealingly, “the people who watch ‘Mad Men’ love the show and watch it religiously,” he added, “and if they see a brand that supports their passion, it’s something they’ll pay more attention to.” Mr. Jauchius likened that fervor for the series to the avid viewership of sports programming. Nationwide is a major advertiser on coverage of Nascar races, sponsoring the Nascar Nationwide Series, and with the National Football League playoffs last year, “we became more of a buyer” of commercial time during football games, he said. The deal between AMC and Nationwide was made during the “upfront” negotiations for the 2012-13 season by the media agency for Nationwide, which is Universal McCann in New York, part of the Mediabrands division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The script for the special commercial was written by AMC, “in close partnership with the Nationwide brand team,” Mr. Jauchius said. (The agency that creates Nationwide’s regular commercials is McKinney in Durham, N.C., part of Cheil Worldwide.) to work with AMC on producing special commercials for “Mad Men” in addition to running regular spots. Others include BMW; the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, for Canada Dry; the Clorox Company, for Clorox bleach; and Unilever, for six brands like Dove, Hellmann’s and Vaseline. Because “Mad Men” is about Madison Avenue, it “is in the unique position of enabling us to tell a brand’s story,” said Scott Collins, executive vice president for ad sales at the AMC and WE TV cable channels that are part of AMC Networks. “We’ve been chasing them and wooing them” to advertise on AMC, Mr. Collins said, referring to Nationwide executives, and thus he was pleasantly surprised when at a meeting he was presented with “this large pitch book, called ‘AMC and “Mad Men” and Nationwide, a Match Made on Madison Avenue,’ ” which recounted the company’s ad heritage. For instance, Mr. Collins said, when he read the slogan “The man from Nationwide is on your side,” “I thought how perfectly ‘Mad Men’-ish that line is,” referring to a central theme of the series, the unequal treatment of the sexes in the 1960s. The special commercial is scheduled to run during the June 16 episode of “Mad Men,” he added, the next-to-last of the sixth season. “It’s a pleasant burden,” Mr. Collins said, to deal with the heightened scrutiny that commercials during “Mad Men” receive, particularly as the series “gets more and more precious as the end nears.” (Plans call for seven seasons.) “There are lots of times I get an e-mail on a Sunday night about a position,” he added, referring to complaints over a spot’s placement. “The reverse would be, no one cares; I cannot tell you how much they care.”</content>

		<content>For iRobot, the Future Is Getting Closer - NYTimes.com BEDFORD, Mass. — Ever since Rosey the Robot took care of “The Jetsons” in the early 1960s, the promise of robots making everyday life easier has been a bit of a tease. Rosey, a metallic maid with a frilly apron, “kind of set expectations that robots were the future,” said Colin M. Angle, the chief executive of the Over the last decade, iRobot, based outside Boston, has emerged as one of the nation’s top robot makers. It has sold millions of disc-shaped Roomba vacuum cleaners, and its bomb disposal robots have protected soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, with Ava, it is using video and computing advances to create robots that can do office work remotely and perhaps one day handle more of the household chores. In late January, iRobot expanded a partnership with InTouch Health, a small company that enables doctors at computer screens to treat stroke victims and other patients from afar. And this week, Texas Instruments said it would supply iRobot with powerful new processors that could help the robots be more interactive and gradually lower their cost. “We have a firm belief that the robotics market is on the cusp of exploding,” said Remi El-Ouazzane, vice president and general manager of the Texas Instruments unit that makes the processors. Mr. Angle’s hopes for broadening the industry’s appeal are shared by other robot companies, which have struggled to expand beyond industrial and military uses, toys and other niche products. Programming robots to mimic human behavior remains difficult. But the ability to use the tablets as simple touch-screen controllers is attracting more software developers, who are envisioning applications that could enhance videoconferencing, provide mobile security guards and sales clerks and help the elderly live longer in their homes. And with their own innovations now at the center of the effort, the technology giants — Apple, Google, Microsoft and the semiconductor companies — are also pushing things along. Mr. Angle, 44, who has been at the forefront of robotics since he was a student at M.I.T., said Ava “is one of the things in our pipeline that I am personally most excited about.” But he cautioned that the robot was still a prototype and would not report for any actual work duties before next year. Mr. Angle estimates that the early versions of Ava will cost in the tens of thousands of dollars, high enough that the company is focusing first on medical applications with InTouch Health, based in Santa Barbara, Calif. InTouch already has robots with video hookups in many smaller hospitals, and they have saved lives in emergencies when specialists could not get there in person. But the doctors have to drive and manipulate the robots with joysticks to see the patients. Mr. Angle said that a tap on Ava’s tablet screen could dispatch it to the right room and free doctors from the more mundane controls. Its mapping system, based partly on Microsoft’s 3-D motion sensor for the Xbox, could enable the robot to hustle to the patient’s bedside without slamming into obstacles. As time goes on, Mr. Angle says he thinks that businessmen could use the robots as proxies at meetings, speaking and watching wirelessly through Ava’s headgear and even guiding her into the hall for private chats. And if the sticker price eventually gets down to consumer levels, as he thinks it will, Ava could, with arms added, dispense pills to baby boomers or even fetch them cocktails. Still, given how long other robotic breakthroughs have taken, Wall Street is not sure what to make of all this yet. As sales of its vacuums and military robots grew, iRobot’s earnings shot up to $40 million last year from $756,000 in 2008, and its stock surged to $38 a share from $7. But with pressure mounting for budget cuts at the Pentagon, Mr. Angle told analysts last month that the company’s military sales could drop by as much as 20 percent this year, and the stock quickly tumbled to $25 to $26 a share.</content>

		<content>Housing Regulator Lifts Objection to $8.5 Billion BofA Deal - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Housing Finance Agency on Friday withdrew its conditional objection to Bank of America Corp's proposed $8.5 billion settlement with investors in Countrywide mortgage-backed securities. A court filing withdrawing the objection did not give any reasons for the FHFA decision and a spokeswoman for the agency was unavailable for comment. A hearing is scheduled to begin May 30 in New York state court on whether the settlement should be approved. The proposed settlement was reached in June 2011 with 22 institutional investors in 530 trusts issued by Countrywide Financial. Countrywide was acquired by Bank of America in 2008. The FHFA oversees mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which back about half of existing U.S. home loans. The enterprises were seized by the government in 2008 as mortgage losses mounted. Justice Barbara Kapnick of New York state court in Manhattan set a May 3 deadline for opponents of the settlement to file objections.

		<content>How the Video Games Industry Is Faring - NYTimes.com Companies in the video games industry have begun releasing earnings reports for the latest quarter. Here's a look at selected companies that make or sell video games or machines. — April 3: Mobile game developer Rovio Entertainment Ltd. says the popular Angry Birds franchise helped it double revenue in 2012 to 152 million euros ($195 million). Net income surged more than 55 percent to 55.5 million euros ($71.2 million). — April 18: Microsoft Corp. says revenue from its Xbox 360 business grew by $641 million, or 55 percent, in the January-March quarter. That's from higher revenue from its Xbox Live service and the recognition of $380 million in deferred video game revenue. Revenue is deferred when video games are sold with software upgrades and enhancements. Like other video game companies, Microsoft spreads that out over time, while the game is played, rather than all at once. — Thursday: Zynga Inc.'s surprise profit in the first three months of the year gets overshadowed by a revenue decline, a drop in the number of users and a lower-than-expected second-quarter forecast. The online games company manages a small profit of $4.1 million, or breakeven per share, by cutting expenses. CEO Mark Pincus says 2013 will "continue to be a transition year." Nintendo Co. says it returned to profit for the fiscal year that ended March 31 as a lift from the weakening yen offset sales struggles caused by software delays for its latest home console, Wii U. Both profit and sales results are slightly worse than the projections of analysts surveyed by FactSet. Wii U sales of 3.45 million units fell short of Nintendo's target of 4 million units in the fiscal year. That already had been lowered from an earlier projection of 5.5 million.</content>

		<content>News Media Weigh Use of Photos of Carnage - NYTimes.com Even for a society comfortable with blood and gore in its movies and video games, the bombings at the The biggest controversy brewed around The Daily News of New York, which covered up a bloody wound on a victim’s leg in the photograph it ran on its front page on Tuesday. As photojournalists on blogs and Facebook discussed how changing these photographs violated their standards, the paper’s spokesman issued a statement on Wednesday defending its decision. It said “the rest of the media should have been as sensitive as The Daily News.” The photograph was first noted by Charles Apple, an editor with The Orange County Register in California. The Atlantic also received complaints from readers for posting on its Web site a photograph of a marathon observer, Jeff Bauman, showing bloody injuries that most news organizations chose to crop. Some organizations that used it also included a note that read “Warning: This image may contain graphic or objectionable content.” About 15 minutes after posting the image, The Atlantic blurred Mr. Bauman’s face, while keeping the troubling parts of the photograph of his limbs in the shot. Bob Cohn, digital editor for The Atlantic, said that it chose to publish an original photograph over the cropped version other outlets published because it seemed more authentic. The Associated Press offered both versions. “We thought it was such an honest and powerful representation of the tragic impact of the bombings,” Mr. Cohn said. Donald R. Winslow, editor of News Photographer Magazine, the monthly publication of the National Press Photographers Association, said that the association’s code of ethics did not allow any altered photographs. It follows the rule that news outlets either publish an image or do not publish it. If parts of the photograph are too graphic, then the image should be cropped. But Mr. Winslow understood that these specific photographs struck a nerve because they were taken at a highly publicized media event where thousands of people were present with digital devices to record it. Most of the time, in places where these types of gruesome tragedies happen, there are fewer people recording the events. “Here in America, we see gruesome photographs that come from war, the third world, a horrible accident or come from European and Middle Eastern terrorism. We typically don’t see those pictures on the front page of newspapers,” Mr. Winslow said. “Not since 9/11, we have not had to deal with pictures from the East Coast mainstream media corridor.” The decision to alter some photographs did not appear to be influenced by concerns from advertisers. Ken Frydman, a spokesman for The Daily News, said that no advertisers asked the paper to alter the photo and had not called to complain. Mr. Cohn said that at The Atlantic he “was not thinking at all about advertising when we made the decision to publish the photo with the warning label and pixelation of the subject’s face.” Mr. Cohn added that Alan Taylor, editor of The Atlantic’s photo blog In Focus, originally chose to use the more graphic photo, but that he and Mr. Taylor decided before publishing the photo to include a warning sign. They also decided together that the Web site should disguise the subject’s face. “He obviously was in a very vulnerable situation. He was fully identifiable,” Mr. Cohn said of Mr. Bauman. But Mr. Winslow said that the decision by The Atlantic to cover Mr. Bauman’s face did little to protect the victim because many outlets ran photographs of him without showing in detail the extent of his injuries. After word spread online that The Daily News had altered photographs, one staff photographer who declined to be identified for fear of being fired said that “people were shocked” in the newsroom and added “it was the chatter of the staff.” Rob Bennett, a photojournalist and adjunct professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, posted on Twitter: “No defense of gore showing up in my circles. Only frustration and disappointment in behavior of @NYDNPhoto dept.” By Wednesday afternoon, The Daily News posted the unaltered version of the photograph on its Web site. Journalists may have debated the slippery slope of altering these photos, but some readers supported the decision of news outlets to edit these shots. Mr. Cohn said that 24 hours after the bombing took place, more readers supported The Atlantic than not.</content>

		<content>Facing Protests, China’s Business Investment May Be Cooling - NYTimes.com But a few hints have surfaced that sentiment for reining in the excessive reliance on business investment might be strengthening even among those segments of the Chinese elite — executives at China’s big state-owned enterprises — that benefit the most from the status quo. Zhu Fushou, the chief executive of the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, one of China’s largest car and truck manufacturers, startled executives at an industry conference in September when he said that China might have almost all the cars it needs, at least for the near-term, and that the government should discourage further investment in the sector. Mr. Zhu called for greater reliance on the free market to determine the winners and losers in major industries, chastising other auto executives for complaining too much about competition. in Chengdu, the main annual conference for executives from Chinese automakers and the China units of global car companies like General Motors and Volkswagen. Mr. Zhu’s remarks were especially striking because of Dongfeng’s longstanding close ties to Beijing as a pillar of Chinese heavy industry ever since Mao ordered its founding in 1969. Mr. Zhu’s predecessor at Dongfeng, Miao Wei, is now the minister of industry and information technology, leading an office that has long favored government-organized oligopolies of state-owned enterprises in many industries. The auto industry in China is operating at about 60 percent of capacity this year, typical of Chinese industries these days, according to a report this summer from the International Monetary Fund. By contrast, United States auto factories and those in other industries usually operate at a much higher rate; even during the worst days of the economic crisis in 2009, capacity utilization in American industry fell no lower than 66.8 percent and then only briefly, according to Federal Reserve data. For many years, economists inside and outside of China have recommended a shift toward more reliance on consumption to sustain growth over the longer run. Progress has been slow, in part because the government has set a cautious pace in offering more medical insurance and pensions, forcing many Chinese to maintain high savings rates to provide their own safety net. But the rising tide of protests against big investment projects may put pressure on Beijing to move faster. Almost every region of China has been affected within the last year or so, starting with a in northeastern China in August 2011; the local government promised a crowd it would close that plant but after the crowds went home, the plant has continued to operate. Just in the last two weeks, there have been numerous demonstrations against a proposed coal-fired power plant on the southeast coast of the island of Hainan and against the expansion of the petrochemical plant in Ningbo, a port near Shanghai. Shifang, the site of the canceled copper smelter, is a town full of retirees that had hoped to create more jobs for its young people, instead of sending them off to factories in Chengdu, a 90-minute bus ride to the south, or even to Guangdong in southern China, a 30-hour train ride. Yet many youths joined the protests here in July, with some even traveling from nearby towns, and the recent Ningbo protests also attracted many youths. The re-emergence of youth protests is surprising because in a nation of one-child families, Chinese parents often seek to stop their offspring from participating in political activity because they worry that it will harm their future careers. The Chinese authorities have shown scant tolerance for anyone who travels to another town to participate in a protest. It is not clear whether Beijing officials will heed further protests around the country or decide instead that they see no other way to stimulate economic growth than to keep fostering ever more heavy industry projects. They appear to be keeping all options open. On the outskirts of Shifang, there was no sign of work at the smelter site, but a uniformed soldier stood near a heavy steel barrier painted in bright red and white. Large signs warned visitors not to enter.</content>

		<content>A Restaurant Owner Tries to Collect an Insurance Payment - NYTimes.com Start-Up Chronicle Getting a restaurant off the ground. Courtesy of Southfork Kitchen.Southfork’s kitchen fire. The smoldering inside the kitchen wall started at 6 p.m. on June 1. At noon on Monday, I was still awaiting the papers to sign in order to receive the third and final check from an insurance company. Between then and now, there have been meetings, pleadings, e-mails, reconstruction, accounting, bewilderment, hair-pulling, teeth-gnashing and lessons I never wanted to learn. My experience with insurance companies had been so minimal that I engaged a public adjuster to deal with the three claims I would be filing. The adjuster, Jeffrey Littman, would get a percentage of what was collected. (In New York, public adjusters can charge up to 12.5 percent; most are willing to negotiate.) I had been paying a total of $1,300 a month to two insurance companies — Scottsdale covers the property and National Specialty covers contents and business interruption. (We managed to reopen for July 4.) Rather than explicating step by arduous step, I have compressed the entire process into a series of pertinent e-mail excerpts between the public adjuster and me — and my insurance agent at the very end. June 16 Bruce, How are you? Please send all receipts concerning the building damages. To collect for the loss of contents, I need the complete inventory and back up documentation to prove all pricing. Invoices and salaries too. Thank you. Best regards, Jeff June 24 Jeff, As requested, here are the numbers for payroll for April and May — 17 FOH [front of house] employees and 13 BOH [back of house]. Shift pay and salaries. Also included are receipts and proposals for the repairs from the electrician, general contractor, stainless steel guy, ECOLAB kitchen rentals, architect, lawyer, Open Table, phones, LIPA [Long Island Power Authority], National Grid, carting service, and clean-up crew. Black Ink Services will send the rest. On Aug. 30, I received a check from Scottsdale Insurance Company — $16,089 less the deductible of $2,500. (The adjuster’s fee has to be subtracted too.) We had receipts for every inch and every shingle and the damage was relatively minor in the kitchen. Payment for the loss of contents would follow shortly, I thought, while the lost business income would take more time to calculate because we had no previous Junes to use to establish our income. Oct. 24 Bruce, The adjuster representing the insurance carrier has requested that more back up documentation be submitted. 1- payroll records 2- bank statements 3- canceled payroll checks 4- New York State Quarterly Sales Reports 5- monthly profit and loss statements 6- schedule used to prepare the analysis for loss of income at $89,663. Oct. 24 Jeff, Wow. The insurance company asks for additional documentation four months after the fact? What have they been doing until now? Is this normal? Oct. 25 Bruce, I met with the adjuster last Friday. We expect to have the authorization from the insurance company on the business property claim this week. Once the authorization is given by the carrier, I will overnight the papers that must be executed by you. If email is more convenient, let me know. I have been assured by the adjuster that once the backup documentation for the income loss is received, it will be worked on immediately. Thank you. Nov. 7 Jeff, Should I sign these Subrogation papers? The Subrogation Receipt gives National the right to recoup money from any party it feels was responsible for any damages to the property or loss of business. Nov. 22 Bruce, I hope all is well. Have a “Happy Thanksgiving.” Attached please find the Subrogation Receipt that you signed. This form must be notarized. If you need a clean form, please let me know. If you have any questions, please call me at the office or my cell. Best regards, Jeff Nov. 23 Jeff, People still have to notarize things? Can I fax the notarized version to you? Nov. 28 Bruce, I have spoken with the accountant who was hired by the insurance company to evaluate your loss of income claim. He is requesting the following additional items be submitted to him for evaluation: 1-Monthly sales for August, September, and October 2011. 2-Profit and Loss Statement for July 1 through October 31, 2011 or monthly profit and loss statements, if available. 3-Bank statement for September 2011. 4-Daily sales for September 2011 5-Payroll records for September 2011. 6-Please provide your schedule showing how you arrived at your claimed amount of $89,663. Nov. 28 Jeff, They need September and October records to reach a settlement? That indicates that they had no intention of paying out anything before the end of the year. Also, what does September and October have to do with June business? This stinks. Dec. 14 Bruce, Good afternoon. I hope all is well. The payment for the lost contents should be sent out by Monday or Tuesday of next week. I am in my office if you need to speak with me. Still working on the business interruption settlement. Dec. 15 Jeff, How come the property portion is taking so long? I can understand the business interruption presenting some issues, but the property was tangible and has known values. Why six months and counting? Dec. 15 Bruce, Good evening. I can only repeat what I wrote to you earlier today. I forwarded the documents to the company adjuster the day I received them from you . … The day that I receive the check it will be sent to by overnight express. Jeff On Dec. 16, National Specialty Insurance Company sent a check for $9,109 to cover lost contents. The settlement was $11,609, less the $2,500 deductible. (And then the adjuster’s fee was subtracted.) Dec. 17 Bruce, Late yesterday I received a copy of the report that was issued by the accountant representing National Specialty Insurance Company regarding your business interruption claim. The accountant has evaluated the findings and determined that the loss of income claim is $26,861, less the 72-hour waiting period deductible of $2,370, for a net collectible amount of $24,491 for you. Dec. 19 Jeff, I dare say, $25,000 doesn’t cover employee salaries for the month of June. This is a rather insane offer. Reading over the numbers, I think I see their trick. They reduce our losses from $189,000 to 107,000 and then give us 55% of that, or $59,000. And then deduct the full amount of our projected payroll taxes, $33,000 (which never happened) and ended up at $24,500 for total lost revenue. Clever. Ruthless. Wrong. Reject it, please. Dec. 21 Bruce, Hope all is well. Because your restaurant has not been open for any previous summers, there are no records for June business. The accountant based his numbers on your September records. Dec. 21 Jeff, From the start, everyone knew we had no previous Junes under our belt. That’s why we sent all our records from April, May, July, August, and September. Please tell the accountant that June is not September. Does he know how a seasonal business works?  Here is some help. I included a bundle of advertisements, travel articles and rental listings to illustrate just how essential June is to a Hamptons business. Jan. 5 Bruce, Happy healthy new year! The accounting firm representing the insurance company has agreed to increase the amount that they are willing to propose to $32,408. The accountant needs to know how much the actual payroll was during the time that the restaurant was closed. The actual and the projected. Thank you. Jan. 5 Jeff, Now we are moving. If the $26,000 settlement was based on September, what is the $32,408 based on? Surely not June’s projected receipts. How and why did they add $6,000 to the last total? Let’s keep pushing. We have the truth on our side. I’d say $50,000 minimum. Thanks. Jan. 10 Bruce, Good afternoon. I just spoke with the CPA firm representing the insurance company. They increased the offer to $35,048. I told him that was not acceptable to you. We argued back and forth for a while. They agreed to re-evaluate his position on the matter. I was promised a new offer by tomorrow. Jan. 10 Jeff, Go get ‘em, tiger. Jan. 11 Bruce, The offer has been increased to $50,180, less the deductible, for a net collectible amount of $47,810. You will not do better than this. If you are willing to accept the offer, please send an e-mail to me stating that $47,810 will be accepted by you for the loss of business income claim. Thank you. Jan. 13 Jeff, The settlement of $50,180 is acceptable for the loss of business claim for Southfork Kitchen. I await the check. Good work. Hope all is well with you and your family. Feb. 3 Bruce, Your insurance carrier, National Specialty Insurance Company, Inc., has determined that you would be entitled to $30,000 plus 4 days @$1,406.00, for a total of $35,624.00. Your policy — $90,000 for business interruption — is written so that $30,000 every thirty days is the maximum. You were closed for 34 days. Attached please find, front and back, a Sworn Statement In Proof of Loss. This form should be signed by you where indicated by the “X”. This form must be notarized. Feb. 3 Jeff, Are you kidding me? This is the amount we rejected a month ago, and it was increased to $51,000 and now we are back to 35,000? Is this legal? Is this ethical? Is this a joke? Can National Insurance string me up and down like a yo-yo? No one read the policy until yesterday? Feb. 4 Bruce, Unfortunately, your policy was written so that $30,000 per month is the maximum. I have not seen many policies written like this. There is nothing I can do. Please sign … I contacted the insurance agent who wrote the policy to double-check this new (old) wrinkle. This is the response. Feb. 4 Bruce, Reviewed your policy file. Yes, $30,000 is the monthly limit for Loss of Income on your current policy … There is nothing that can be done now unfortunately, but going forward, this monthly limit can be increased to reflect actual values needed. Let me know and I will get a quote. Feb. 5 1. Is this monthly maximum still in place? 2. If so, it has to be increased ASAP. It is insufficient. 3. Can I have quarterly coverage? That is, can June, July and August have a higher maximum than the other months for business interruption? Or do I have to pay per annum? Feb. 5 Jeff, National says I get $30,000 and $1,406 for four additional days. I cannot figure out how they reached that daily number — $1,406. Every way I slice the pie, I get a different number. Feb. 6 Bruce, I contacted the insurance company and after some discussion, they agree — there has been an error, and the number is too low. They will recalculate the settlement and get back to us next Monday. Jeff So, here I sit, waiting to sign a settlement for the third and final check. When the check arrives, almost eight months after the minor damage in the kitchen wall was repaired, I will have collected about $56,000, minus the adjuster’s fee. This amount does not equal the actual losses — food, salaries, construction, accountants — and does not offset one penny of lost business. I am increasing my business interruption coverage to $75,000 a month. I am researching new carriers and new agents. I am happy to have had some coverage, but wish I had a whole lot more. I will give the last words to the public adjuster, which are almost the same words he told me when we first spoke. Feb. 10 Bruce, I am sorry, but no, you cannot add interest to the insurance company settlement. In fact, if you read the policy, they don’t have to pay you anything. Then you would have two years from the date of incident to sue them to collect. As you now see, insurance companies move at their own speed and come to their own conclusions and there is not much you can do about it. I have been working in this business for 30 odd years. You never really know what’s in your policy until you try to collect. And then it’s too late. Best regards, Jeff Bruce Buschel owns Southfork Kitchen, a restaurant in Bridgehampton, N.Y. It will reopen May 1.</content>

		<content>Hong Kong Still Attracting Retailers Despite Forbidding Costs - NYTimes.com HONG KONG — Hong Kong is one of the busiest and most crowded shopping meccas in the world — with sky-high retail rents to match — but that has not stopped retailers from opening yet more stores in the city, which has seven million inhabitants and attracts millions more visiting consumers each year. The latest arrival is Tommy Bahama, a U.S. clothing and lifestyle brand, which joined the fray Wednesday with the opening of a 370-square-meter, or 4,000-square-foot, store in the Wan Chai district, its first outlet in the city. But the store, said Terry Pillow, the chief executive, is “one of the most expensive locations” the company operates — “in a similar range” as a recently opened, significantly larger, flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. Reports from the real estate services company CBRE last year ranked Hong Kong as the world’s most expensive location for prime real estate and office rents, and ECA International, which advises companies posting employees abroad, published a poll this week showing that Hong Kong was the most expensive place to rent high-end apartments. Likewise, the cost of buying a home has soared despite repeated efforts by the government to cool the market. Moreover, even those companies that are prepared to bite the bullet on rent might struggle to find what they need. It took Mr. Pillow and his colleagues at Tommy Bahama, whose casual wear is in the “affordable luxury” range of the market, four years to find a site they liked, in terms of store size and location. They considered many of the high-end shopping malls, which include all the usual suspects of the fashion world, but in the end, they settled on Wan Chai, a neighborhood that is better known for its bars and nightlife than for high-end shopping. But that fits with Tommy Bahama’s neighborhood-bar-type image, the company’s executives said. “We were in a hurry to come to Hong Kong, but it was important for us to come to Hong Kong in the right way,” Mr. Pillow said. So acute is the space-cost situation that analysts have begun to warn that Hong Kong has become too expensive for its own good. Executives at CBRE in Hong Kong said last October that the space constraints meant the city’s standing as a key location in Asia was “under threat.” Long waiting lists for spots in schools and high housing costs add to the financial pain and are increasingly causing companies to think twice about deploying expatriate employees or expanding teams in the city. “Hong Kong has been losing out to Singapore in the past few years because of that,” Lee Quane, regional director for ECA International, said by telephone. Similarly, in the retailing sector, the lack and cost of suitable space has meant that some companies have taken relatively long to come to Hong Kong, industry analysts and real estate experts say. Gap and American Eagle Outfitters, for example, opened shops in Hong Kong only in 2011. Forever 21, another popular U.S. brand, opened a large store in the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay early last year, and Abercrombie and Fitch’s flagship store, in the heart of Central, the financial district, opened last August. The British brand Topshop, which is well established in other parts of Asia — it has eight shops each in Indonesia and Malaysia, six in Singapore and four in Japan, among others — is opening its first store in Hong Kong this year, in May. But retailing executives clearly believe that the expense of having a presence in Hong Kong is worth it. After all, the city’s shopping population is hugely increased by the millions of tourists who flock to the city every month. Last year, 48.6 million visitors came to Hong Kong, nearly three-quarters of them from mainland China, whose increasingly affluent consumers are eager to capitalize on the lower taxes in Hong Kong and greater certainty that what they are buying is the genuine article. For retailers like Tommy Bahama, Louis Vuitton and Prada, a store in Hong Kong means visibility that extends well beyond the city, which is a special administrative region of China, into the mainland Chinese market. “It’s a dog-eat-dog world out there,” said Rob Goldberg, senior vice president for marketing at Tommy Bahama, referring to Hong Kong’s property and rental costs. “But if you can make it here, you’ll make it anywhere.” Tommy Bahama executives said they were “very happy” with the performance of the Hong Kong store so far. The shop opened quietly two weeks ago but had its official ribbon-cutting event Wednesday.</content>

		<content>HCA, Giant Hospital Chain, Creates a Windfall for Private Equity - NYTimes.com During the Great Recession, when many hospitals across the country were nearly brought to their knees by growing numbers of uninsured patients, one hospital system not only survived — it thrived. HCA’s robust profit growth has raised the value of the firms’ holdings to nearly three and a half times their initial investment in the $33 billion deal. The financial performance has been so impressive that HCA has become a model for the industry. Its success inspired 35 buyouts of hospitals or chains of facilities in the last two and a half years by private equity firms eager to repeat that windfall. HCA’s emergence as a powerful leader in the hospital industry is all the more remarkable because only a decade ago the company was badly shaken by a wide-ranging Among the secrets to HCA’s success: It figured out how to get more revenue from private insurance companies, patients and Medicare by billing much more aggressively for its services than ever before; it found ways to reduce emergency room overcrowding and expenses; and it experimented with new ways to reduce the cost of its medical staff, a move that sometimes led to conflicts with doctors and nurses over concerns about patient care. In late 2008, for instance, HCA changed the billing codes it assigned to sick and injured patients who came into the emergency rooms. Almost overnight, the numbers of patients who HCA said needed more care, which would be paid for at significantly higher levels by Medicare, surged. HCA, which had lagged the industry for those high-paying categories, jumped ahead of its competitors and was reimbursed accordingly. The change, which HCA’s executives said better reflected the service being provided, To some, HCA successfully pushed the envelope in its interpretation of existing Medicare rules. “If HCA can do it, why can’t we?” asked a hospital consulting firm, the Advisory Board Company, in a presentation to its clients. In one instance, HCA executives said a private insurer, which it declined to name, questioned the new billing system, forcing it to return some of the money it had collected. The hospital giant also adopted a policy meant to address an issue that bedevils hospitals nationwide — reducing costs and overcrowding in its emergency rooms. For years, the hospital emergency room has been used by the uninsured as a de facto doctor’s office — a place for even the most minor of ailments. But emergency care is expensive and has become increasingly burdensome to hospitals in the last decade because of the rising number of uninsured patients. or even a sprained wrist, unless those patients paid in advance. In a recent statement, HCA said that of the six million patients treated in its emergency rooms last year, 80,000, or about 1.3 percent, “Many E.R.’s in America, particularly in densely populated urban areas where most HCA-affiliated facilities are located, have adopted a variety of systems to determine whether a patient in fact needs emergency care,” the statement said. “About half our hospitals have done so. Typically, our affiliated hospitals have two caregivers — usually a triage nurse and a physician — make that determination. It should be noted that other non-HCA affiliated hospitals are using similar processes to address E.R. issues.” As HCA’s profits and influence grew, strains arose with doctors and nurses over whether the chain’s pursuit of profit may have, at times, come at the expense of patient care. HCA had put in place a flexible staffing system that allowed it to estimate the number of patients it would have each day in its hospitals and alter the number of nurses it needed accordingly. Several nurses interviewed said they were concerned that the system sometimes had led to inadequate staffing in important areas like critical care. In one measure of adequate staffing — the prevalence of bedsores in patients bedridden for long periods of time — HCA clearly struggled. Some of its hospitals fended off lawsuits over the problem in recent years, and were admonished by regulators over staffing issues more than once. Many doctors interviewed at various HCA facilities said they had felt increased pressure to focus on profits under the private equity ownership. “Their profits are going through the roof, but, unfortunately, it’s occurring at the expense of patients,” said Dr. Abraham Awwad, a kidney specialist in St. Petersburg, Fla., whose complaints over the safety of the An earlier version of this article imprecisely referred to the state of Mitt Romney’s candidacy.

		<content>Microsoft, Weather Company and More Make Ad Pitches - NYTimes.com ANNOUNCEMENTS by giant media companies about new series and other programming ventures. Appearances by pop-culture personalities like the rappers Lupe Fiasco and MC Hammer. Performances by singers like the Lumineers, dancers and circus acts. Free breakfasts, lunches, hors d’oeuvres and drinks. Goody bags filled with giveaway items that include smartphone covers, computer monitor cleaning cloths and cookies. As networks and channels preview for Madison Avenue their lineups ahead of the 2013-14 television season — hence the term upfront — companies that produce digital content like online video and streaming video are also putting on presentations in hopes of attracting advertising dollars from marketers and agencies, either diverted from television budgets or additive spending. So eager are those companies to woo the television crowd that they are sponsoring this week, under the aegis of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, five mornings, afternoons and evenings of events, receptions and parties under the banner of the . To underline the difference, the official logo for the event depicts the words “Upfronts” with the “Up” ; the Weather Company, which considers itself an expert in content on four screens: television, computers, smartphones and tablets; and The Wall Street Journal, which sought to draw attention to its video content and advertising with an event that Journal executives called Newsfront 2013. (Upfronts, NewFronts, Newsfront — it can get pretty confusing.) For a publisher known for print media seeking to become identified in digital realms, “you’ve got to get to critical mass,” Michael F. Rooney, chief revenue officer at The Journal, part of the Dow Jones and Company division of News Corporation, said in an interview after The Journal’s 90-minute presentation. , now has “enough inventory to get people to pay attention,” said Mr. Rooney, who also spoke during the presentation along with senior executives like Lex Fenwick, chief executive at Dow Jones and publisher of The Journal; Gerard Baker, managing editor of The Journal; and Chris Cramer, head of video operations. The executives announced video initiatives that include “WSJ Startup of the Year,” an episodic documentary for WSJ Live, sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange and evocative of a reality competition series. Starting on June 24, 25 entrepreneurs will work with more than two dozen mentors like Richard Branson, Tory Burch and MC Hammer; the recommendations of the mentors, and viewer votes, will guide editors of The Journal as they winnow the contenders and select a winning start-up. For the Weather Company, the presentation was the second in less than four weeks; the company offered a look at its 2013-14 programming lineup for the Weather Channel cable network in New York on April 3. Asked before the presentation if the company was taking too many bites of the upfront apple, David Kenny, chairman and chief executive at the Weather Company, replied: “There are different capabilities here, a ton of capabilities. There’s a lot of unique content you can only do in digital.” Another reason to take part in the Digital Content NewFronts, Mr. Kenny said, was that among the buyers of commercial time at media agencies, “there are some who buy both” television and digital, “but there are many who focus on digital and we need to show them what’s here.” “And for us, a big leader in mobile, showing what mobile can be is important,” he added. “The mobile audience is here, and wouldn’t be at a cable upfront.” Among the announcements by the Weather Company was an expansion of video content under the banner of Weather Channel Films, which will be on the Weather Channel network as well , on smartphones and on tablets. The company is adding three Web series to the three it announced at the Weather Channel upfront; the series, with titles like “Alive” and “I Am Unstoppable,” will run from July through December. “We want to superserve the weather enthusiast,” said Curt Hecht, chief global revenue officer at the Weather Company, using a term the company coined to describe its most ardent viewers, on whichever screens. There will be an “investment in video content that you’ve never seen before from this company,” he added, a promise he underlined by repeating it at the end of the presentation. Thumping house music — and dancers and acrobats dressed in sequined and gold-and-silver lamé body suits — welcomed guests to the Marquee club for the Microsoft presentation. “As you know we are entering a world of always on,” said Keith Lorizio, vice president for United States sales and marketing at the Microsoft Advertising division of Microsoft. The setting was certainly “on,” with agency executives and employees lining the walls and crammed into the seats. Mikhail Lapushner, chief executive at One Beat, a media company that focuses on creating content in the electronic dance music genre, announced a series of new shows that will be geared toward a young, dance-loving audience. “It’s all about the millennials,” Mr. Lapushner said. One Beat, in partnership with Xbox, the Microsoft video game system, will create and distribute original content for the Web. Among the shows previewed were “Keep It Moving,” which chronicles the lives of four up-and-coming music promoters. Contrasting with the youth-inspired theme, and the gyrating dancers who performed briefly at every transition between speakers, was a show called “Years of Living Dangerously,” a Showtime television series that will be focused on climate change; the show will also be seen online, at various Microsoft platforms.</content>

		<content>What's at Stake in the Fight Over a REIT - NYTimes.com Harry Campbell If you want to see one possible dystopian future for takeovers, you should take a gander at what is going on in the takeover bid for CommonWealth REIT, a real estate investment trust that owns more than 500 office buildings. It’s not pretty, and it’s all a result of  CommonWealth’s claim that all its disputes with shareholders must be arbitrated. In some ways, the contest for CommonWealth is a fairly normal hostile bid with heated rhetoric, lots of litigation and managers who have grown rich from operating the company and who do not appear to want to go quietly. In February, Corvex Management, a hedge fund headed by a former employee of Carl C. Icahn, and the Related Companies announced the acquisition of 9.8 percent of CommonWealth and an offer for the REIT at $25 per share, threatening to go hostile if CommonWealth failed to enter into negotiations to sell to the two new shareholders. The two shareholders also demanded that CommonWealth halt a stock offering of 27 million shares. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools CommonWealth ignored the demand. Corvex and Related responded as you would expect. They sued in Federal District Court in Boston to stop the offering, but failed to persuade a judge to halt the sale. Corvex and Related, meanwhile, also raised the ante by starting a hostile offer and a consent solicitation to remove the board. The consent solicitation requires that two-thirds of Commonwealth’s shareholders agree. This is a high threshold, though, and there are lots of other barriers to the takeover bid. CommonWealth has stiff takeover defenses, including a poison pill that limits Corvex and Related to acquiring no more than 10 percent of its shares. The company also has a staggered board. Ordinarily, that would mean that all the directors couldn’t be unseated at once, because only roughly a third are up for election in any given year. The two provisions would ordinarily make a takeover of Commonwealth quite difficult because it would take two years to replace a majority of the board’s directors and force the redemption of the poison pill. But there is a flaw in CommonWealth’s organizational documents. CommonWealth directors can still all be removed and replaced at any time by written consent without cause outside the company’s annual meeting. This is a way around the poison pill. Corvex and Related can simply remove these directors and replace them with new people who will redeem the pill. CommonWealth is led by  Adam Portnoy, the president, and his father, Barry Portnoy, who founded the company. They are two of the five trustees on CommonWealth’s board. CommonWealth itself has no employee managers. And so the Portnoys also lead the management company that runs CommonWealth for a fee. The Portnoy’s management company was paid $77.3 million last year to operate CommonWealth. But while the fee appears to be lucrative, CommonWealth’s returns are not. From Jan.  1, 2007, to Jan. 15, 2013, its stock price  declined almost 68 percent. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the money at stake, CommonWealth, whose ticker is CWH, has fought a vicious defense. Its board had rejected the funds’ offer and the company has stated that Corvex and Related’s bid would allow the funds “ to seize control of CWH for their own benefit, or, alternatively, to realize a quick profit by forcing a sale of CWH before the full benefits of CWH’s current business plan are realized.” CommonWealth has also fought this bid not on the merits but through legal machinations. On March 1, CommonWealth’s board passed a bylaw amendment that purports to require that any shareholder wishing to undertake a consent solicitation must, among other things, own 3 percent of the company’s shares for three years. This is an extremely aggressive position that if upheld would stop Corvex and Related in their tracks. Not satisfied with this attempted knockout blow, CommonWealth appears to have lobbied the Maryland Legislature to amend the Maryland Unsolicited Takeover Act. This law allows companies to have a mandatory staggered board. CommonWealth already has such a board, but the company has also reportedly lobbied the legislature to make a change that companies opting into this statute would now be unable to have their directors removed by written consent. Again, this would kill Corvex and Related’s campaign. When the two funds got wind of this, they fought back, and the Maryland legislature adjourned without adopting CommonWealth’s proposal. CommonWealth still announced this week that it had opted into the act. The REIT is claiming that even though the Maryland Legislature did not adopt any amendment, the law still implicitly has this requirement. The funds will now have to sue CommonWealth to force them to change their interpretation. So, let’s just start by acknowledging that this a particularly nasty contest, but that legislative maneuvers and extreme bylaws are not unusual in these situations. Just recently, Iowa adopted a mandatory staggered board requirement after Iowa-based Casey’s General Stores was subject to a hostile bid. Still, shareholder governance experts are likely to view CommonWealth’s actions as over the top. And we can probably all agree that they are not the most shareholder-friendly actions. Not only that, but if CommonWealth were a Delaware company, where most public corporations are incorporated, the judges in that state would have a field day with CommonWealth’s actions. The bylaw amendment would be struck down almost immediately. But CommonWealth is a Maryland REIT. This does not end the matter. CommonWealth’s acts are also likely to be viewed as extreme by a Maryland court, and Related and Corvex are suing in Maryland State Court to obtain this determination. The problem is not Maryland law, but that CommonWealth has a bylaw provision that requires all shareholder disputes to be arbitrated. When CommonWealth filed for an initial public offering, it included a provision requiring arbitration of all shareholder disputes in its charter. The Securities and Exchange Commission frowns on these provisions and forced the REIT to remove it. But CommonWealth refused to give up, and after its initial public offering,  the  board on its own and without shareholder approval adopted a requirement that all shareholder disputes be arbitrated. CommonWealth is now claiming that the dispute in the Maryland court should go to arbitration. Corvex and Related are protesting, claiming that the shareholders never consented to arbitration and that moreover the requirement is illusory because it puts CommonWealth in control of the arbitration. In defense, the REIT  asserts that by buying shares with knowledge of the bylaw, shareholders implicitly accepted this bylaw. CommonWealth is again taking an aggressive position, but the courts have been trending toward increasing acceptance of arbitration even with these types of consents. Still, no court has yet to go this far. But while they are protesting, Corvex and Related are hedging their bets and proceeding with arbitration on a parallel track. You can get an idea of each parties’ attitude from their choice of arbitrators. The funds have picked William B. Chandler III, the former chief of the Delaware Chancery Court, the nation’s preeminent corporate law court, as their arbitrator. CommonWealth, meanwhile, has selected a person whom Corvex and Related allege is a friend of the Portnoys and sometime business partner (CommonWealth’s bylaw specifically allows for the arbitrators to have a relationship with the parties). The two arbitrators will now select a third arbitrator. And when will a decision be rendered? Who knows – this could take years. And this is the problem. No matter if they are wrong under the law, CommonWealth can use the arbitration process to delay this for years. And any arbitration is likely to be done in secret with no real right of appeal. And this is why this case is so important. If the Maryland court upholds CommonWealth’s arbitration provision, more companies like Commonwealth can simply adopt these bylaws. They can then take aggressive positions to resist a takeover, and the results will be sent to the black hole of an arbitration conducted in secret and with no timeline for an outcome. So the real question is what the Maryland court does and whether it upholds the arbitration provision. To my knowledge, no court has ever ruled on whether shareholders are required to arbitrate their claims through a bylaw amendment passed by a board but not shareholders. But with no compromise in sight, we’re about to get our first ruling with real consequences for the takeover market. Steven M. Davidoff, a professor at the Michael E. Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University, is the author of “Gods at War: Shotgun Takeovers, Government by Deal and the Private Equity Implosion.” E-mail: dealprof@nytimes.com | Twitter: @StevenDavidoff</content>

		<content>Electricity Costs Rise in New England, Which Relies on Natural Gas - NYTimes.com Electricity prices in New England have been four to eight times higher than normal in the last few weeks, as the region’s extreme reliance on last week have revived concerns about the lack of alternatives to natural gas. Many plants that ran on have been shuttered, and the few that remain cannot be put into service quickly enough to meet spikes in demand. The price of electricity is determined by the price of gas. Last year, natural gas provided 52 percent of New England’s electricity, and that share is expected to grow. Gas is generally cheaper than other energy sources, and the lower costs have spurred the retirement of aging coal generators and nuclear reactors. The six-state New England region and parts of Long Island are the most vulnerable now to overreliance on gas, a vulnerability heightened by a shortage of natural gas pipeline capacity, but officials worry that similar problems could spread to the Midwest. “We are sticking a lot of straws into this soft drink,” said William P. Short III, an energy consultant whose clients include companies that move and burn gas. “This is a harbinger of things to come in New England, as well as New York.” , a company that, through its subsidiaries, provides electricity to homes and businesses in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, said: “There is concern we don’t have enough capacity to supply heating and electricity generation.” Northeast and many other companies are temporarily insulated from the spot market because they sign long-term contracts for electricity supply. But Northeast’s energy charges next year could be 10 percent higher than they are now, Mr. Daly said, because the companies that sell power on a long-term basis will charge more to absorb the risk of short-term spikes in prices. “It is certainly true that a region like New England that relies on a single fuel source like natural gas for the bulk of its power does leave itself open for more disruptions than a region with a more diverse fuel mix,” said Jay Apt, executive director of the at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “It’s not a knock against natural gas; it’s a knock against a single fuel source.” that demand is outpacing the delivery capacity of gas infrastructure. At coal plants, “you can look out the window and see that 60-day supply of your fuel,” said Joe Nipper, the group’s senior vice president of government relations. But gas plants tend to deliver fuel just as it is needed. The gyrations of the spot market are hard to follow because prices are set in units few consumers understand. Electricity is sold on the wholesale market in megawatt-hours, or thousands of kilowatt-hours; a megawatt-hour is enough to run a big suburban house for a month. Natural gas is sold in a unit called an MMBtu, or a million British thermal units. An MMBtu equals 10 therms, the unit home heating customers pay for. The problem began late last year. During a cold snap around Thanksgiving, electricity prices in New England shot up to On Jan. 24, the cost of an MMBtu of natural gas at Algonquin Citygate, a spot near Boston where gas is traded, rose to $31.20, pushing the price of a megawatt-hour over $200. Constellation Energy, which operates plants in the region, A megawatt-hour cost about $150 early this month, according to weekly reports from ISO New England, the independent operator that maintains the region’s electricity market. A year ago, the price was around $30. , New England would have been toast,” Mr. Short said. “We’re importing 1,400 megawatts out of New York.” Indian Point is a twin-unit nuclear plant on the Hudson River that New York State But the region is littered with 1950s- and 1960s-era coal and oil plants that have been retired in the last few years. The 214-megawatt, coal-fired AES Thames unit near Uncasville, Conn., shut down in 2011; Somerset Station, a 174-megawatt, coal-fired plant in Somerset, Mass., closed in 2010. The Salem Harbor plant in Salem, Mass., once had four coal and oil units, with a capacity of 745 megawatts. Two have closed, and the others will probably close next year. A new owner The underlying issue in New England is that gas pipeline capacity is inadequate to keep prices steady in times of high home heating demand, said Vamsi Chadalavada, executive vice president and chief operating officer of ISO New England. ISO is leading a study focused mainly on reliability, but reliability is intertwined with price, he said. Importing liquefied natural gas would help, Dr. Chadalavada said, but cargoes are going instead to Europe and South America, where prices are higher. Several companies want to liquefy and export gas from the continental United States because of the shale gas glut, and the events in New England could affect that debate. Opposition has come mostly from domestic industries that use the gas. A spokesman for Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said Mr. Wyden saw the price gyrations in New England as a reason to “look before we leap ahead with unfettered exports of gas.” But the biggest problem may be the inadequacy of existing pipelines. On Feb. 7, ISO New England told the that it was concerned about “increasing reliance on natural gas-fueled generators at times when there is an increasingly tight availability of pipeline capacity to deliver natural gas from the south and west to New England.” Additionally, experts say that the natural gas market and the electric market mesh poorly, because while the electric market runs around the clock, the gas market closes down at night. During the storm last week, with transmission lines being knocked out by snow and high winds, ISO asked some gas-fired generators to start running in the middle of the night, Dr. Chadalavada said, and found they could not. “We were sitting here, 3 in the morning, trying to get gas generators to start up, and we started seeing where they couldn’t access that market in the overnight hours,” he said. About 30 percent of the generators in the region burn coal and oil, Dr. Chadalavada said, but they produce less than 1 percent of the energy because they run so seldom. Some can take 24 hours to return to service. ISO and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees interstate electricity and gas markets and transmission, are trying to make the systems mesh better.</content>

		<content>After Apple’s Rise, a Bruising Fall - NYTimes.com Wall Street has turned viciously on its one-time iDarling. The rout in Apple’s share price — it fell nearly 2.7 percent on Thursday, bringing the damage since late September to 44 percent — has many wondering when, and where, all of this will end. The answer, of course, is that no one really knows. Yes, Apple is slowing, as companies inevitably do. But Apple remains enormously profitable and the envy of corporations worldwide. And yet Apple’s decline in the stock market has been so swift and so brutal that the development has begun to change the way investors view the company. Apple no longer looks like a sure thing. It is a remarkable turn in one of the standout stock market stories of recent years. Only seven months ago, Apple’s share price raced above $700 to a record high, making Apple the most valuable company on the planet. By Thursday, the stock had sunk to $392.05, closing below $400 for the first time since late 2011. The proximate cause of Thursday’s decline was news this week of a glut of audio chips at one of Apple’s suppliers. That, in turn, prompted concern that sales of iPhones might fall short of expectations. But that was just one more bit of downbeat news in what has been a downbeat few months. All told, $290 billion has been wiped off Apple’s value since September. It might seem difficult to believe, but Apple now ranks among the biggest losers in the stock market over the last seven months, right next to the J. C. Penney Company, that sick man of American department stores. The last time Apple was trading this low was in November 2011. Steve Jobs had just died and everyone wondered how Apple would carry on without its visionary leader. Stock price aside, Apple is bigger and, by some measures, stronger today that it was then. It sells more iPhones and iPads than ever. It is expanding its global reach. And it is making so much money — analysts expect the company to report another solid quarter next week — that it has been having trouble figuring out what to do with all of its cash. Speculation is rife that Apple might pass some cash to shareholders in the form of an increased stock dividend. On one level, the Apple story is a common one on Wall Street: what goes up also goes down. As Apple’s stock price soared in recent years, some pointed out that the company’s sales couldn’t keep growing — and its share price couldn’t keep rising — at that rapid pace forever. In hindsight, Apple’s surge above $700 strikes some as irrational, as does its precipitous plunge back below $400. “Overexuberance on the upside leads to herd behavior and panic during the correction,” said Avanidhar Subrahmanyam, an professor of behavioral finance at U.C.L.A. “People just panic and the stress hormone kicks in.” One issue is that Apple is a favorite stock among individual investors. The investment firm SigFig estimated last fall that 17 percent of all retail investors owned Apple stock, four times the number that owns the average stock in the Dow Jones industrial average. Trading by retail investors can be amplified by hedge funds, who see everyday investors piling in and push in the opposite direction by shorting the stock, betting it will decline. The so-called short interest in Apple reached a peak last November, but hasn’t gone down much since then, according to data from Nasdaq. Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at New York University, said the enthusiasm surrounding Apple last year prompted him to sell his own holdings in the company when the stock was around $610. “I was terrified by the kinds of investors coming into Apple’s stock,” said Mr. Damodaran. “Not only were they coming in with unrealistic expectations, they were at war with each other.”</content>

		<content>Federal Mortgage Success Stories - NYTimes.com Article Tools The government’s takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, The New York Times’s Eric Dash writes, is training a spotlight on a part of American financial system that rarely gets much attention: the vast network of federal agencies and quasi-governmental lenders that helps keep credit flowing through the economy. So far, these government-linked lenders – including other, smaller Maes and Macs – have come through the credit crisis largely unscathed. Some of them, in fact, are even prospering. The Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, or Farmer Mac, for example, has been on a roll lately. Its shares have soared 153 percent this year, and its profit is up. Chartered by the federal government in 1988, Farmer Mac buys mortgages on farmland from agricultural lenders and then sells instruments backed by those loans. The company is thriving because the price of crops – and farmland – has been rising. The Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, meantime, has also come through the last year without the credit problems that have brought Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to their knees. Fully owned by the federal government, Ginnie Mae provides guarantees on mortgage-backed securities backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans. Earlier this year, Ginnie Mae’s sales of new government-guaranteed debt soared to the highest point since 2003, as the market for other mortgage-linked debt collapsed. Still, some worry that the rapid growth of other government-sponsored enterprises, most prominently the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks, eventually might create headaches for the financial industry and American taxpayers. The Federal Home Loan Banks, which like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac help finance housing, are like the troubled mortgage giants in at least one crucial respect: size. The F.H.L.B. system is enormous – and getting bigger. Over the last year alone, the combined value of these institutions’ balance sheets has ballooned by 30 percent. And, like, Fannie and Freddie, the 12 banks borrow large amounts of money in the bond markets. Their debt outstanding totals about $1.3 trillion. Over the last year or so, the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which is run as a cooperative by the nation’s banks, rather than as a public company, has been a crucial source of funding for lenders. The home loan banks borrow money in the capital markets, securing low rates because of their implied backing by the federal government, and then lend that money to banks. That has been crucial during the current crisis as traditional sources of funding have dried up. “It became the lifeline to liquidity for all of us. There is no doubt about it,” Ronald E. Hermance Jr., the chief executive of Hudson City Savings Bank and a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, told The Times. “It is what kept the system alive.” Eleven of the 12 home loan banks have been profitable lately, although one, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, recently lost money when some of its hedges on mortgage investments went awry. As part of the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Treasury said it would extend secured, short-term funding to the home loan banks. James B. Lockhart, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said on Sunday that the home loan bank system was “very unlikely” to need to use that facility. But the home loan banks, which were created during the Depression amid a wave of bank failures, have lent billions of dollars to banks and thrifts that are themselves exposed to troubled home loans. Washington Mutual, the nation’s largest savings and loan, nearly doubled its borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank System over the last year, to $47.7 billion, according to government filings. The Wachovia Corporation has also ramped up its borrowing, in part because of its acquisition of Golden West, a big California lender. In 2007, before it was sold to Bank of America, the Countrywide Financial Corporation took out more than $53.2 billion as it fought to stay afloat. Collectively, the home loan banks have never reported a loss in the system’s 76-year history. Many experts say the risk that lenders will fail to pay back the home loan banks is small, particularly because the loans are secured by collateral in the form of high-quality mortgages and other protections. Still, the explosive growth of the system concerns some analysts, who worry that the loan banks enable overly aggressive lenders to continue to make loans. “The accusation is that they are the ones that continue to provide alcohol to the alcoholic borrower that just can’t get off the sauce,” Gary Townsend, a manager of a hedge fund oriented toward the financial sector who spent seven years as the chief examiner of the F.H.L.B. system, told The Times. “They continue to entice the borrower to borrow more and more.” The costs, if any, ultimately might be borne by the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation and, by extension, taxpayers. When a lender fails, the home loan banks are repaid before the F.D.I.C., which guarantees checking and savings accounts. “Any financial institution that is involved in the housing market could be in risk if home prices continue to plunge and the housing crisis doesn’t start to abate,” Jaret Seiberg, a banking policy analyst at the Stanford Group in Washington, told The Times. Even so, the risks to the loan banks appears small. “Of all the entities involved in the market, the Home Loan Bank System is pretty protected,” Mr. Seiberg said.

		<content>Life Sciences Dominate at Wharton Competition - NYTimes.com Lionel Nicolau Cortical Concepts, winners at Wharton’s business plan competition. The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania held its 12th annual business plan competition on Wednesday. Eight finalists were selected from the 231 teams that applied. Cortical Concepts took the grand prize of $20,000 cash, and $10,000 worth of in-kind accounting and legal services, for its plan to sell a device that would make spine surgery safer for patients with osteoporosis or weak bones. Stephanie Huang, a first-year medical student at the University of Pennsylvania, described the so-called Cortical Anchor device as a kind of “drywall anchor” for the spine. She and her teammate Jason Hsu came up with the concept as undergraduate bioengineering students at Johns Hopkins University. The device would be used, Ms. Huang said, in surgeries that require segments of the spine to be stabilized with screws and rods. Such procedures can fix broken backs and alleviate pain from herniated discs when bones are healthy. But, Ms. Huang explained, patients with osteoporosis who need these surgeries are at risk of having the screws loosen in their backs. When that happens, they must endure expensive, painful revision surgeries. About 100,000 people each year in the United States who have osteoporosis and need spinal fixative surgery would benefit from the Cortical Anchor, said Cortical Concepts’ chief of operations Nicolas Martinez, a student in the Biomedical Engineering master’s program at Johns Hopkins. Each Cortical Anchor would cost $400, said Mr. Martinez, noting that comparable alternatives can cost upward of $1,000. “Besides saving elderly patients a lot of pain,” he said, “we could save the health care system $7,000 to $10,000 per case or about $700 million per year.” In their deliberations, judges highlighted the fact that to become operational, Cortical Concepts would have to achieve various patent protections and Food and Drug Administration approvals. But they liked the simplicity of the solution, and they also lauded the fact that the team obtained external validation from orthopedic surgeons at Johns Hopkins. Several judges joked that it was difficult to choose a winner among this year’s group without a patent attorney present. Josh Kopelman, a Wharton alumnus and managing director of First Round Capital who has judged at this competition for several years, noted that only 15 percent of this year’s applicants but 75 percent of the finalists were in life sciences. Wharton has had a streak of biotech winners in recent years, but the competition has also served as a launch pad for companies selling everything from tacos to anti-microbial, refillable water bottles. Second prize of $10,000 cash and $10,000 in business services was awarded to NanoLab, a company offering a portable diagnostic device that can tell in 15 minutes if a patient has AIDS, cancer or heart disease and that is 20 times more sensitive than existing diagnostic tools. NanoLab’s team leader, Michelle Gaster, an M.B.A. candidate at Wharton, said the company’s diagnostic tool uses technology created and patented by her twin brother, Richard Gaster, an M.D.-Ph.D. candidate at Stanford. It involves magnetic sensors, and reads protein concentrations in blood or saliva to deliver results. NanoLab plans to make money less by selling the device than by selling the disposable “sticks” used in it. The company is far from market ready and plans to use its competition money to continue legal and laboratory research, and to compete again, including at the Stanford Social E-Challenge, for grant money to develop the product. Wharton’s third-place winner, R2R Therapeutics, is developing a new form of antibiotic drug that will fight hospital-acquired infections that are resistant to antibiotics. In his presentation, R2R’s chief executive, Ben Rhee, said that his wife had suffered from a hospital-acquired bacterial infection. The company’s drug, still in a pre-clinical stage, would attack the outer membrane of bacteria, unlike existing antibiotics, which work on the inner mechanisms of bacteria. Maxine Gowen, president and chief executive of Trevena, Inc., a privately held drug discovery and development firm, said that while she was “amazed to see a group of plans balanced between therapeutics, diagnostics and devices,” she believed most of the student start-ups she judged had significantly under-estimated the amount of time and money it would take to get their products to market. She also said these considerations can pose a challenge, even for seasoned entrepreneurs. See The Prize’s guide to coming business plan competitions. And here’s how to win a competition.</content>

		<content>6 Things to Ask Before Booking a Summer Vacation - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (AP) — It's May. Memorial Day and the end of the school year are in sight. Suddenly, you're thinking about a summer vacation. A little advance planning — and some insider tips — can save you a lot of money. Whether you're booking airfare, a car rental or a hotel room, there are questions you should ask first. A: There is no overarching rule, but generally the sweet spot for buying is four to six weeks before you travel. Prices are highest eight to 10 weeks and two to three weeks in advance. However, start your search earlier, if possible. Learn what fares tend to be on a route so you can jump on a deal when one appears. Timing it right can save a family hundreds of dollars. And remember, with most fares you now have 24 hours to cancel for any reason. Use that to your advantage. Q: Is it worth paying for extras such as more legroom, access to shorter security lines and early boarding? A: There are a number of variables to consider here, including the length of your flight — and your legs. The airline and time of day can also matter. You can buy your way to the front of a security line. United, for examples, charges $9 for the privilege. But first consider the time you're flying. At lunchtime on a Tuesday, the airport is probably empty anyway. However, if you're leaving Orlando or Las Vegas on a Sunday, the fee could be money well spent. Boarding early improves your chances of finding overhead space. But that's about it. If you don't have a carry-on bag, then save the money — typically $10 each way. Only on Southwest — which doesn't assign seats — is there an additional advantage: being first to pick where to sit. Then there's legroom. JetBlue charges extra for seats in the front of the plane with more legroom. But its standard seats already have three inches more legroom than a similar seat on United. "Preferred seats" on American Airlines start at $4 and climb to $99, depending on the length of a flight. But there isn't extra space — you're just nearer the front. Use sites like A: The rental firms sell collision damage waiver (CDW) insurance for up to $25 extra a day. It offers protection from theft, vandalism or other damage. It's a major source of revenue. Decide whether you need this insurance long before you get to the counter. Your personal insurance policy likely covers rental cars. It probably also extends liability insurance to your rental, which you also need. But confirm this well ahead of time with your insurer. Many credit cards offer rental car insurance. Some offer primary insurance. Most only cover what your personal insurance does not. And cards have plenty of exclusions. If you are renting for more than two weeks or traveling to Ireland, Israel, Jamaica, Australia, Italy or New Zealand, you might not be covered. Exotic and luxury cars, some vans, motorcycles and SUVs aren't covered. Your card probably doesn't cover the rental company's "loss-of-use" fee — a surcharge for the revenue lost while the vehicle is in the shop. Some personal insurance policies cover this, some don't. Pay for the rental with the card that gives you the best protection. Debit cards typically don't offer the same coverage. As for liability insurance, if you don't have a personal policy you should probably buy this extra coverage, which costs a few hundred dollars. Or if you rent frequently, insurance companies will sell you annual non-owner car insurance policies. A: You don't need to pay up to $14 extra a day for a GPS. If you own a portable GPS, bring it with you. Or use your smartphone. Just be warned: using the smartphone's GPS tends to drain its battery. An automatic toll collection device will cost about $5 a day. It can save you time at busy toll plazas if you're traveling during holiday weekends. But when traffic is normal, it is harder to justify the time savings. If you decline the service and the car still has a toll device, make sure it is properly stored in the protective case. If a toll booth picks up the signal you'll be charged the toll and face a hefty penalty from the rental company.</content>

		<content>GM Says Chevy Spark EV Can Go 82 Miles Per Charge - NYTimes.com DETROIT (AP) — General Motors said Wednesday that the battery-powered version of its Chevrolet Spark mini-car can travel up to 82 miles on a single charge, putting it among the leaders in mass-market The Spark EV also gets the equivalent of 119 miles per gallon in testing monitored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. GM said that makes it the most efficient car available for sale to the public. The figure is for combined city and highway driving. The tiny electric Chevrolet goes on sale in July in Oregon and California. GM hasn't released the price but has said it will be less than $32,500, excluding a $7,500 federal tax credit. The company also hasn't said when it will go on sale in other states. The Spark enters the market at a time when gasoline prices nationwide are relatively low. The average price of a gallon of regular gas on Wednesday was $3.52, 33 cents less than the same time last year, according to AAA. Lower gas prices and a limited range have held down U.S. electric car sales. Automakers sold almost 4,900 fully electric vehicles in the first quarter of this year, nearly three times the number from a year ago, according to the Edmunds.com automotive website. But that's only 0.13 percent of total U.S. car sales. Other electric cars can travel farther on a single charge. The Fiat 500e, for example, can go 87 miles on a charge according to EPA estimates, while versions of the Tesla Model S can travel up to 265 miles per charge. GM's Chevrolet Volt can go 38 miles per charge, which is less than all-electric cars because the Volt has a smaller battery and a gas-powered generator that kicks in after the battery is depleted. The Volt gets the equivalent of 98 miles per gallon on both electricity and gasoline, according to the EPA. The EPA calculates the gas mileage equivalent for electric cars like this: One gallon of gasoline creates the same energy as 33.7 kilowatt hours of electricity. It then determines how far an electric car can travel on that amount of battery power. The Scion IQ EV has a higher gas mileage equivalency figure than the Spark EV at 121 mpg, but Toyota said it is offered only to partners for testing purposes. The motor and other driveline parts for the Spark EV are made in Baltimore, but the car is assembled in South Korea along with the gasoline version.</content>

		<content>Momentum Seems to Build for Gargantuan Buyout of Dell - NYTimes.com Kimihiro Hoshino/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesDell’s founder, Michael Dell, is expected to contribute his own $3.6 billion share in the company to the possible deal. Dell is advancing toward a goal many thought was all but unattainable since the financial crisis: a leveraged buyout worth more than $20 billion. The company is in talks with investment firms and its founder, Michael S. Dell, over a deal that would take the technology company off the public markets, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. One potential transaction that appears to be gaining steam is one that would be led by Silver Lake, a private equity firm that focuses on technology deals, one of these people said. The investment shop has already tasked a number of banks — Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse and Royal Bank of Canada — with lining up the enormous amount of financing that would be needed, perhaps as much as $16 billion. Silver Lake is also sounding out potential partners that could help contribute equity financing for the deal, a group that may include wealthy Asian investors, this person said. Article Tools Dell is contemplating using some of its enormous store of cash, totaling about $11.3 billion as of Nov. 2, to help defray the deal’s cost. It may do so even though more than 80 percent of its cash is held overseas, and bringing it home could generate a big tax penalty. Mr. Dell is expected to contribute his roughly 16 percent stake in the company to the deal, helping to lower the ultimate price tag. His shares as of Tuesday’s market close were worth about $3.6 billion. It is unclear whether he would invest additional money as part of a buyout. Nonetheless, the deal talks appear to have momentum, although one of the people briefed on the matter cautioned that they could still fall apart. Representatives for Dell, Silver Lake and the banks declined to comment. Should a deal come together, it would be the most radical step yet to revive a company once so profitable that it gave rise to a class of “Dellionaires” during the Internet boom. Mr. Dell, who founded the computer maker in his dorm room in 1984, has long cast about for a solution to a world where revenue from personal computer sales has consistently fallen in recent years. Behind any move to take Dell private is the hope that, freed from the tough scrutiny of public shareholders, the company can continue moving into the more lucrative and stable market of providing hardware and software services for corporations. The company’s stock had fallen nearly 48 percent in the five years through last Friday, the day before Bloomberg News reported Dell’s talks with private equity firms. Since then, the stock price has climbed 21 percent. A leveraged buyout of Dell would be one of the biggest private equity transactions since the Blackstone Group acquired Hilton Hotels for $25 billion more than five years ago. To date, no leveraged buyout announced since the financial crisis has surpassed the $7.2 billion that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and others paid for the Samson Investment Company, an oil and gas driller, in fall 2011. In part, that has been a matter of logistics. Leveraged buyouts require private equity firms to put money down, much as borrowers do for a mortgage. On average, that amount has been around 30 percent of the overall deal price, meaning that the equity required for a Dell takeover could be significant. That is why Silver Lake is seeking to bring in at least one partner to help buoy a bid, one of the people briefed on the matter said. But private equity firms have also taken pains to avoid club deals, in which two or more of them partner together to buy a company. Investors in these firms have complained that the practice essentially multiplies their exposure to a particular transaction. Private equity firms aren’t fond of them because they essentially erase the distinctions between competitors, potentially making it harder to raise money for new funds. Any deal would also require a seemingly daunting amount of debt financing, raised from bank loans and junk-bond sales. Several deal makers have expressed confidence in their ability to raise that money, given a hunger among investors for bonds that yield even a few percentage points more than Treasury bonds. The co-head of JPMorgan Chase‘s global debt capital markets, Jim Casey, told CNBC in October that his firm could raise $15 billion to $25 billion in noninvestment-grade debt for a single transaction. Some of the other obstacles to a Dell takeover lie specifically with the company. It already bears $4.9 billion in long-term debt — and that is before it assumes the enormous amount that would come from a private equity deal. While Dell still reports a healthy amount of cash from operations, totaling $3.7 billion for the year ended Nov. 2, much of that could be consumed with paying down debt. A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, estimated on Tuesday that the company could pay about $820 million in interest payments each year. Analysts have questioned whether a private Dell would have the capital to pay for acquisitions, which has been an important vehicle for expanding into new markets. Last year alone, the company struck 10 deals, including the $2.4 billion purchase of Quest Software. “With a large debt load, we believe Dell would have a more difficult time acquiring smaller enterprise companies — making it harder to diversify away from PCs,” analysts with Barclays wrote in a research note on Tuesday. “We would be quite surprised if a transaction would take place.” Babu/ReutersA Dell factory in India. The company’s stock had fallen nearly 48 percent in the five years before the possible leveraged buyout was reported last week. Ben Protess contributed reporting.

		<content>How S.andP. Tempted Arthur Andersen’s Fate - NYTimes.com By the government account, the crucial event that sent S.and P. down the road to crime and shame came in 2004, when the housing boom was a pale shadow of what it would become. “We just lost a huge Mizuho R.M.B.S. deal to Moody’s due to a huge difference in the required credit support level,” an analyst wrote in a e-mail. “What we found from the arranger was that our support level was at least 10 percent higher than Moody’s.” That, the government said, spurred S.and P. to find ways to assure that it would not lose deals in the future. If that meant compromising its integrity, that was acceptable to the people running the agency. I wondered what happened to that deal, which was sponsored by Mizuho Financial, a Japanese bank. It turns out that the deal, issued in Japan and backed by Japanese mortgages, worked out very well. All the investors were repaid. That same Japanese bank, as it happens, provides some evidence to support an S.and P. defense argument — that it moved faster than its competitors in 2007 to downgrade bad securities. The government complaint says that in the spring of 2007, as the C.D.O. market was starting to collapse, S.and P. worked with banks to let them issue C.D.O.’s with ratings that the agency knew were not deserved. But by July of that year, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, S.and P. had announced new rating procedures that would have kept Mizuho from getting the desired ratings on a C.D.O. it was about to issue. Mizuho, the S.E.C. lied to S.and P. about what was in the C.D.O., and got the desired AAA rating. Within six months, the C.D.O. was in default. The fact that S.and P. was fooled may not speak well for its procedures and competence, but it does seem to indicate that in 2007 at least one of the banks pushing bad C.D.O.’s out the door thought S.and P. could not be relied upon to help it deceive investors. The traditional ratings agency defense of free speech — this was our opinion and even if it turned out to be wrong we are not liable — will be in trouble if the government’s case that S.and P. knew it was handing out undeserved ratings stands up. That defense has already failed in , in which a judge found no “reasonably competent ratings agency” would have given it the rating S.and P. did. IMF, an Australian firm that finances litigation in return for a share of the proceeds if the litigation succeeds, audit, had no inkling the company was in danger of collapse when he sanctioned some questionable accounting over the objection of experts in Andersen’s national office. If S.and P. analysts and executives acted as the government says they did, they presumably thought there were large enough margins of safety in their assumptions that cutting a few corners would not hurt. Floyd Abrams, a partner in Cahill Gordon and Reindel who is representing S.and P., points out that the government case quotes from no secret whistle-blower, indicating that while the government has interviewed a lot of people from S.and P., including many who have left, it found none who would support the claim that the ratings were knowingly wrong. He notes that in 2007 those who thought the housing mess would not lead to disaster included the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, as well as S.and P. S.and P., like Andersen, issued opinions that turned out to be disastrously wrong. The firm needs to prove those were honestly held opinions, not ones motivated by greed. If the government can prove otherwise, S.and P.’s future may be bleak.</content>

		<content>Antivirus Makers Work on Software to Catch Malware More Effectively - NYTimes.com Imperva, which sponsored the antivirus study, has a horse in this race. Its Web application and data security software are part of a wave of products that look at security in a new way. Instead of simply blocking what is bad, as antivirus programs and perimeter firewalls are designed to do, Imperva monitors access to servers, databases and files for suspicious activity. The day companies unplug their antivirus software is still far off, but entrepreneurs and investors are betting that the old tools will become relics. “The game has changed from the attacker’s standpoint,” said Phil Hochmuth, a Web security analyst at the research firm International Data Corporation. “The traditional signature-based method of detecting malware is not keeping up.” Investors are backing a new crop of start-ups that turn the whole notion of security on its head. If it is no longer possible to block everything that is bad, the thinking goes, then the security companies of the future will be the ones whose software can spot unusual behavior and clean up systems once they have been breached. The hottest security start-ups today are companies like Bit9, Bromium, FireEye and Seculert that monitor Internet traffic, and companies like Mandiant and CrowdStrike that have expertise in cleaning up after an attack. Bit9, which received more than $70 million in financing from top venture firms like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital, uses an approach known as whitelisting, allowing only traffic that the system knows is innocuous. , a whitelisting start-up, in 2009, and Symantec’s products now include its Insight technology, which is similar in that it does not let any unknown files run on a machine. McAfee’s former chief executive, David G. DeWalt, was rumored to be a contender for the top job at Intel, which in 2010. Instead, he joined FireEye, a start-up with a system that isolates a company’s applications in virtual containers, then looks for suspicious activity in a sort of digital petri dish before deciding whether to let traffic through. The company has received more than $35 million in financing from Norwest, Sequoia Capital and In-Q-Tel, the venture arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, among others. Seculert, an Israeli start-up, approaches the problem somewhat differently. It looks at where threats are coming from — the command and control centers used to coordinate attacks — to give governments and businesses an early warning system. As the number of prominent online attacks rises, analysts and venture capitalists are betting that corporate spending patterns will change. “Technologies that once were only used by very sensitive industries like finance are moving into the mainstream,” Mr. Hochmuth said. “Very soon, if you are not running these technologies and you’re a security professional, your colleagues and counterparts will start to look at you funny.” Companies have started working from the assumption that they will be hacked, Mr. Hochmuth said, and that when they are, they will need top-notch cleanup crews. Mandiant, which specializes in data forensics and responding to breaches, has received $70 million from Kleiner Perkins and One Equity Partners, JPMorgan Chase’s private investment arm. Two McAfee executives, George Kurtz and Dmitri Alperovitch, left to start CrowdStrike, a start-up that offers a similar forensics service. Less than a year later, they have already raised $26 million from Warburg Pincus. If and when antivirus makers are able to fortify desktop computers, chances are the criminals will have already moved on to smartphones. that a number of malicious apps were compromising Android devices. And in July, Kaspersky Lab discovered the first to protect mobile devices from malware. McAfee, Symantec and others are working on solutions, and Lookout, a start-up whose products scan apps for malware and viruses, recently raised funding that valued it at $1 billion. “The bad guys are getting worse,” Mr. Howard of Norwest said. “Antivirus helps filter down the problem, but the next big security company will be the one that offers a comprehensive solution.”</content>

		<content>Apple's Cash Plan Takes Heat Off Cook, Buys Him Time - NYTimes.com Cook has in the past year presided over three straight quarters of missed revenue expectations before the January-to-March period. The key product introduced during his tenure is the smaller iPad mini, a response to tablets such as Amazon.com Inc's Kindle that were making inroads on its home turf. The public takes as a given that a new iPhone and new iPads will come this year, along with refreshed Mac computers and iPod music players. But the speculation is that Apple is also working on a watch, a television and a radio service, among other products in the pipeline. Cook would not provide any more details on new products, no surprise given the company's penchant for secrecy. "The bar has been reset in terms of expectations and guidance. They have done the right thing by issuing debt and doing a large buyback," said Jason Jones, who runs tech hedge fund firm HighStep Capital and confessed to being an Apple bull. "The company will go through this quiet period for product release and then, starting in the summer and for the remainder of the year, product announcements will pick up and likely the stock will react favorably to that." While Apple is still growing - no small achievement for a company with sales well over $100 billion - its pace of growth has slowed as high-end smartphone adoption approaches saturation and rivals flood the market with cheaper devices, which are popular in high-growth developing countries like China and India. Cook on Tuesday acknowledged that Samsung, which has smartphones in all price categories, is its top competitor. Apple also said it does sacrifice margin in the short-term, as it did with the iPad mini, if executives believe a product has long-term potential. "Apple is in the transition phase from growth to a value company," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. "Growth companies tend to put every penny back in, but that is not the case with Apple here."

		<content>New Solar Process Gets More Out of Natural Gas - NYTimes.com Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Wash., hope by this summer to carry out the test, which entails a process that could cut the amount of natural gas used — and the greenhouse gasses emitted — by 20 percent. “We can reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and the consumer doesn’t get hit,” said Robert Wegeng, the researcher in charge of the project. The system is a marriage of chemical engineering and mechanical engineering. The process will work anywhere it is sunny, according to researchers, although it might be more valuable in places where natural gas is relatively expensive, or where a company making electricity would be paid for generating less carbon dioxide. The project, financed with $4.5 million in federal stimulus money, is still in development, and experts say the technology’s costs have yet to be established. The process also is several major steps away from commercial viability. Using the sun’s heat to make electricity is hardly new; as far back as 2007, companies were building plants to boil water into steam and turn a turbine. In Australia, Areva built a plant that helps reduce the amount of coal needed to make electricity by using solar power to preheat the water that the burning coal boiled into steam. The new system captures solar energy in a chemical form, using the sun’s heat to break open the molecules of natural gas (four hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom) and water (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom) and reshuffle them into something that burns better: carbon monoxide and pure hydrogen. The result also has carbon dioxide, which is inert. The mixture, called synthesis gas, is a common building block in the chemical industry, but it requires energy to make it, usually from burning natural gas. In the Pacific Northwest design, that energy comes from the sun. Sunlight falls on a mirrored dish that looks a bit like an upturned umbrella, and focuses on a spot where the umbrella handle would be. It heats water and natural gas to 700 degrees Celsius, about 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. A catalyst breaks the molecules up and the atoms are reassembled. Laboratory officials say they have improved the efficiency of the process. But they also have introduced a second innovation: before the synthesis gas is sent to a turbine for burning, a new kind of heat exchanger extracts some heat from it. That heat is added to the chemical reactor, further improving the efficiency of the solar side of the process. If the system starts with one million B.T.U.’s of natural gas, the standard unit for pricing, then the synthesis gas has a value of about 1.25 million B.T.U.’s That means turning $4 of gas into $5. Michael E. Webber, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin and a co-director of the clean energy incubator there, cautioned that there were still a lot of “engineering kinks to sort out.” He called the resulting gas “a wonderful fuel, but it’s a pain in the neck to make.” The technology might be economical in a place like Japan, where natural gas prices are higher, he said. “We might as well master the technology and sell it to them,” he said. Researchers hope they can find other improvements that will probably be necessary to win commercial acceptance of the technology in North America, where gas prices are low. Mr. Wegeng also said that mass production would drive down prices of the necessary components. Unlike other forms of solar energy, the hybrid solar/gas plant is intended to supply steady levels of electricity. “When the sun is shining, you get this solar augment to the fuel,” said Mr. Wegeng. If clouds roll in, or if the sun sets, then the turbine can burn ordinary natural gas and produce the same amount of electricity. “You’re just using more natural gas,” he said.</content>

		<content>3M and Avery Dennison 'Committed' to Deal Despite Antitrust Issue - NYTimes.com Scott Eells/Bloomberg News3M is the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch Tape. 3M‘s acquisition of an Avery Dennison unit was in limbo on Wednesday, as the companies scrambled to clear regulatory obstacles. The Justice Department balked at the $550 million deal, threatening to file a civil antitrust lawsuit against the companies, which sell labels and sticky notes. On Tuesday, the department announced that 3M had “abandoned” its takeover plans in the face of a court battle. But just hours later, the companies vowed to keep fighting. In a statement late on Tuesday, 3M and Avery Dennison clarified that they “voluntarily” withdrew the paperwork for the deal as they sought to appease the Justice Department’s concerns. Article Tools Related Links Documents: The companies' news release Documents: The Justice Department news release The companies said they were “committed to working together to explore options” for completing a deal with regulatory approval. “The companies continue to believe the transaction would benefit customers and consumers,” the statement said. The all-cash deal was announced in January. 3M, the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch Tape, agreed to buy the office and consumer products business of the Avery Dennison Corporation, which makes folder dividers, labels and a popular brand of highlighters. While the deal excluded some of Avery Dennison’s sticky notes business, the Justice Department argued the company would no longer “compete effectively in the sticky notes market.” Jason Szenes/European Pressphoto AgencyAvery Dennison officials at the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. “The proposed acquisition would have substantially lessened competition in the sale of labels and sticky notes, resulting in higher prices and reduced innovation for products that millions of American consumers use every day,” the Justice Department said on Tuesday. Regulators said the two companies were each other’s closest competitors in the adhesive label and sticky notes business. And under the terms of the deal, according to the Justice Department, 3M’s share of the market would have jumped to more than 80 percent. The deal was part of a broader acquisition spree for 3M, a manufacturing conglomerate. Last year. the company bought Advanced Chemistry and Technology, a maker of aerospace sealants; assets from Zargis Medical, a medical software maker; and Hybrivet Systems, which makes lead detection products.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com Article Tools Groupon’s Latest Valuation Raises Doubt | Back in 1999, Barron’s ran an article that was a virtual indictment of Amazon. It questioned the company’s ability ever to turn a profit, argued that Amazon was spending far too much money on marketing and suggested that the company was using misleading accounting metrics.

		<content>DuPont Profit Doubles as Drought Boosts Farm Sales - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Chemicals maker DuPont's quarterly profit more than doubled as the worst dry spell in decades encouraged U.S. farmers to buy its drought-hardy seeds and crop-protection products to boost yields. Strong wheat, corn and soybean prices also spurred agricultural sales in the Americas, helping DuPont beat estimates for the quarter despite an ongoing decline in demand for its once-lucrative titanium dioxide paint pigment. The Wilmington, Delaware-based company's shares traded up 0.7 percent at $50.74 before the bell on Tuesday. "The first quarter finished as expected, with the strong agriculture performance and performance chemicals' decline from peak levels last year," DuPont Chief Executive Ellen Kullman said in a statement. The 210-year-old company, known for its chemicals business, is focusing on food and agriculture products that are less exposed to ebbs and flows in titanium dioxide (Ti02) sales. The shift is evident in the $5 billion sale of its car paint unit last year and the $6 billion purchase of nutritional supplements maker Danisco in 2011. "Ti02 has declined and it's a much smaller factor now. We also think it is bottoming so it's become less of an issue," John Roberts, who leads U.S. chemical coverage at UBS Investment Research, said ahead of the announcement. He had expected first-quarter earnings of $1.55 per share, above the Wall Street estimates of $1.52 per share. Excluding one-time items, DuPont earned $1.56 per share. The company's net income for the quarter, which included the beginning of the North American spring planting season, jumped to $3.35 billion, or $3.58 per share, in the first quarter, from $1.49 billion, or $1.58 per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose marginally to $10.4 billion on higher prices for seeds and crop protection products and demand in North America and Latin America. Agriculture business was the biggest source of revenue in the fourth quarter, contributing almost 45 percent. The performance chemicals business, which includes titanium dioxide sales, accounted for about 15 percent. Spiraling prices for wheat, corn and soybean have also helped boost sales for rivals Monsanto Co and Syngenta AG</content>

		<content>Small Deals, Big Issues - NYTimes.com Article Tools Once again, last week was a relatively quiet one in the takeover markets, with small transactions dominating the headlines (other than General Motors, of course). But in some respects, a review of these transactions shows that the issues arising in small deals are often larger than those in big ones. Or at least it seems that economies of scale do not exist in the deal world: The same issues that plague big takeovers often affect smaller ones. To illustrate, let’s review last week’s deal action. Life Sciences Research More than five months after Life Sciences Research disclosed that its chairman and chief executive, Andrew Baker, had made a proposal to acquire the company for $7.50 a share, or roughly $100 million, a transaction agreement was announced Thursday. Mr. Baker and his affiliated company are now offering $8.50 in cash to acquire Life Sciences. Mr. Baker currently owns 17.5 percent of Life Sciences. When I wrote about Mr. Baker’s proposal in March, I speculated that the conditionality of his offer and his inclusion of a due-diligence requirement raised the prospect that this was another Landry’s in the making. Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the legal aspects of mergers, private equity and corporate governance. A former corporate attorney at Shearman and Sterling, he is a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. His columns are available at The Deal Professor blog. In the Landry’s deal, the company’s chief executive and largest shareholder, Tilman Fertitta, appeared to have leveraged his position to negotiate quite a good deal for himself — a deal that subsequently cratered, at no cost to Mr. Fertitta, while leaving him in control of Landry’s (For more on the Landry’s saga, see my previous post.) In the case of Life Sciences, it appears that the board’s special committee bargained better, though some caveats are in order. From a review of the merger agreement, it appears the acquisition has a majority-of-the-minority provision, which requires that a majority of shareholders other than Mr. Baker approve the deal. The most interesting things about this deal are the termination fee provisions. The deal has a two-tiered reverse termination fee: $2.23 million is payable by the acquirer if the deal fails because of financing, and $4.46 million if the acquirer intentionally breaches and walks from the transaction for any other reason. The latter fee is 5 percent of the transaction value, excluding Mr. Baker’s interest. The Life Sciences transaction is yet another anecdotal marker that reverse termination fees are creeping up. But interestingly, the target has the same provision — it can walk for any reason by paying a $4.46 million termination fee. In this light, the fact that the parties kept the material adverse change clause in the merger agreement is puzzling. Why bother? The termination fees provide the same function without the need to litigate the issue. Here, the acquisition agreement has an arbitration provision for disputes — quite a rarity. So, if there are disputes, the march down to Delaware that typically occurs would be absent. I am surprised that the target would allow for this provision, as it benefits the acquirer by depriving the target of a public forum, though this may help if indeed there is a material adverse change dispute. In that case, the target would not have to litigate in public about how bad it is. Instead, it can do so privately. Finally, the press release has the statement that “[t]he merger agreement is not subject to a financing condition.” This is a pet peeve of mine. If the acquirer has a walk right upon payment of a reverse termination fee, this is a back-door financing condition. To trumpet the lack of one and not mention the reverse termination fee is disingenuous and misleading at best. MSC Software Last Tuesday, MSC Software announced that it was being acquired for $360 million by the private equity firm Symphony Technology Group. None of the recent innovations in terms of deal certainty were contained in the acquisition agreement for this transaction. Instead, with one caveat, there is optionality all over the transaction. The deal is a pure reverse termination fee transaction — for the payment of $16.8 million, the acquirer can walk at any time. Notably, this fee is higher than the $11.8 million termination fee payable by MSC if a higher bid emerges. It is also a higher 4.67 percent of the deal value; this is the one change, toward less optionality, from the traditional private equity model, which was historically 3 percent of deal value. But there is also a working capital condition of $113 million and a cash requirement at closing for MSC of $143 million. The interesting twist on this deal is that Elliot Associates owns about 13 percent of MSC and is providing “debt and equity financing” to complete the transaction. What does that mean? How much is it for? Well, we don’t know. MSC filed the limited guarantee with the Securities and Exchange Commission but did not file the debt and equity commitment letters. Another pet peeve of mine — half-hearted disclosure, which appears to be hiding something, as well as a failure to disclose the financing commitment letters. The nondisclosure might not mean anything, but since this appears to be a 13e-3 going-private transaction, these will need to be filed later because of Elliot’s involvement. Why not do it now and let the market know exactly what Elliot’s role is and the terms of their financing and role in this acquisition? Startech Environmental If you are bored this Monday afternoon, I have a test for you. Find out for me who is offering to acquire Startech Environmental Corporation. Sure, it would be easy to go to Edgar and pull the tender offer to purchase. In fact, it is right here. If you did so, you would find that the bidder is FLH Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Friendly LRL Holdings L.L.C., which is an indirect subsidiary of LRL Investments Ltd. Okay, but who is LRL Investments? According to the offer to purchase, “LRL Investments Ltd. is a company organized in 2006 under the laws of the Cayman Islands with principal executive offices located at 16, rue de Contamines, 1206 Geneva, Switzerland. Its telephone number at that address is +41 22 704 32 00. The activities of LRL to date have focused on investment opportunities in the technology sector.” If you read further you will find that LRL “is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Composition Foundation, which is governed by a Council composed of Mr. Kunz and Mr. Zindel. The Council of Composition Foundation is directed by a Curatorium, composed of two members, Mr. Timoshin and Mr. Mitirev.” Mr. Kunz and Mr. Zindel are Swiss citizens who are trust nominees. Mr. Timoshin and Mr. Mitirev are Russian citizens and associated with Bank Uralsib. So, it appears that this deal is put forth by a Russian bank, but one can’t be sure. If you find out more, feel free to post in the comments. You might want to call the number above and ask. More generally, I’ve always found it curious that in the United States, tender offers do not need to be guaranteed by a domestic bank. This sort of requirement is standard in Europe, where financing conditionality is not generally permitted. In this case and in a small deal, the gap is apparent. What would happen if LRL Investments reneged? Likely nothing. Its citizens are offshore and ownership here is almost impossible to track and decipher. But the question is: why should this be the case? Galil v. Healthtronics Healthtronics and Galil Medical settled their litigation for a payment of $1.75 million on the eve of trial. (See this post for more on Galili’s allegations of tortious interference of contract vis-à-vis Galil’s agreement to acquire Endocare.) The payment is being made by Endocare’s current acquirer, Healthtronics, to Galil. This is more than the $900,000 termination fee in Galil’s now-terminated merger agreement with Endocare, showing the power of a tortious-interference-of-contract claim. That power appears to be $850,000, or almost double the termination fee. Not bad. Entrust Thoma Bravo on Friday raised its offer to acquire Entrust to $2 a share from $1.85 a share. In exchange, Entrust agreed in its acquisition agreement to pay up $2 million if Entrust’s shareholders vote no on the transaction. On a $124 million transaction, this is 1.6 percent of deal value. I am not aware of a third party bid here, so I suspect the raise was to clinch a shareholder vote. But 1.6 percent of deal value is on the high side, though after the Lear case last year, almost certainly makes this valid under Delaware law. Entrust is incorporated under Maryland law though and although Maryland hasn’t addressed these types of fees, the state is more lenient on transaction defenses. And ultimately the 1.6 percent is high, but higher break fees are the norm on small deals.</content>

		<content>Not Your Ordinary Swap Meet - NYTimes.com Article Tools An obscure pressure point in the credit squeeze popped up this week when a boutique investment bank in Houston held a “public auction” for dozens of the most arcane products in the financial world. The auctioneer was the Sanders Morris Harris Group, whose chairman is George L. Ball, a former governor of the American Stock Exchange who served high-profile stints at the helms of Smith Barney Shearson and Prudential nearly two decades ago. The auction was announced last week in legal notices in the back pages of The Wall Street Journal. The notices looked like the kind that advertise a sheriff’s sale of repossessed cars, but actually invited bids on 55 “synthetic securities,” put up for sale on Wednesday along with dozens of more conventional “securities” – mostly pools of mortgages with ratings ranging from so-so to awful – that were auctioned over two days. The notices warned that all the goods, like fine art at Sotheby’s, “may be subject to a reserve level,” allowing the seller to refuse all bids if none met its minimum price. So, given the jitters in the market, how did it go? Hard to say. Mr. Ball’s firm declined to comment on the auction at all, citing the wishes of its client, the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation‘s trust company, which arranged the auction for an unnamed investor. The Bank of New York, in turn, declined to disclose either who was selling the swaps and securities or how the auction went. “In our role as trustee, we can’t comment on the results of this or any other auction,” Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the bank, told The New York Times. So about all that can be said is that the seller is not related to Mr. Ball’s firm – Mr. Heine was authorized to say that the bank picked the firm because it is a neutral party – and had pretty sophisticated tastes. The 55 “synthetic securities” up for bid were described as “pay-as-you-go credit default swaps.” They are a mutation of products originally meant to provide protection to investors if a corporate borrower defaulted on its bonds or other debts. In recent years, however, default swaps have become a popular way to place bets on corporate credit trends among traders with no vested interest in the underlying debt. That has prompted enormous growth both in swaps volume – the market is now estimated at more than $45 trillion – and in the potential risks in what remains an opaque, largely unregulated market. For example, the American International Group recently reported that it had miscalculated the value of swaps contracts on its books, an error that added $3.6 billion to its loss estimates for last year. But unlike plain vanilla credit default swaps – if such a thing can be said to exist – the pay-as-you-go swaps do not involve a one-time payment to cover a default on a corporate bond, a pool of mortgages or some other debt instrument. Instead, they involve the payment of ongoing obligations on debt instruments that, because of their terms, may not be subject to a clear default trigger. These 55 swaps, in particular, involved promises to pay shortfalls on various collections of mortgage loans, most of which have been sharply downgraded by ratings agencies in recent weeks. If these had been more conventional credit default swaps, there would have been a much more visible way to sell them. Indeed, last Tuesday, just such an auction was held for credit default swaps affected by the bankruptcy of Québecor World, a Canadian printing company that filed for protection under Canada’s bankruptcy laws on Jan. 21. There is no mystery about the outcome of that event. Unlike the Houston auction, it was conducted pretty much in plain sight. Bids and offers were submitted through an electronic auction platform created by Creditex, an interdealer execution platform for credit derivatives, and Markit Group, a price information service. The results – which allowed participants to calculate the value of their swap obligations by fixing the price of the underlying debt at 41.25 cents on the dollar – were verified by Markit and jointly announced by the two firms on Tuesday afternoon. In fact, the bids submitted by each of the 13 participating dealers, by name, is posted on the Internet at www.creditfixings.com. “You can go check our math,” joked Mazy Dar, chief strategic officer for Creditex. The firm has now conducted 11 credit default swap auctions, beginning with one for swaps involving Collins and Aikman debt in 2005. Other auctions involved the debt of Market Gallery, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Corporation, Delphi Corporation, Calpine Corporation, Dana Corporation and Dura. The process is sufficiently trusted that 589 market participants agreed in advance, through the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, to abide by whatever settlement price the auction established for the Quebecor-related swaps. But unlike widely traded credit default swaps, which have become fairly standardized, pay-as-you-go swaps remain highly individualized. Underscoring how distinctive each of the 55 swap contracts are, Sanders Morris Harris offered to supply “the complete terms of any synthetic security” to interested bidders. And, obviously, since these highly differentiated swaps are rarely traded, there’s no market price to guide bidders – or owners. Hence, the public announcement of the unpublic auction. Bankers said that, while this was not a first, “synthetic securities” auctions like the one in Houston are still pretty rare – so far. But as more holders of these oddball swaps look for ways to value them, or unload them, it might be a good idea to check the legal notices a little more often.

		<content>Analysis - Tax Strategy May Be Key to Verizon Wireless Deal - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc's chances of buying the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless owned by Britain's Vodafone Group Plc will hinge, at least in part, on the quality of tax advice it is getting. Verizon, the No. 2 U.S. telecommunications company, may have found a way to structure a purchase of the stake so that Vodafone can avoid a multibillion-dollar U.S. capital gains tax bill, sources familiar with Verizon's plans said. The possibility of a huge tax bill has previously been regarded by analysts as a big hurdle to any such deal. Reuters reported last Wednesday that Verizon was preparing a bid worth about $100 billion to take full control of Verizon Wireless - it already owns the other 55 percent - by buying the stake, according to people familiar with the matter. There are no guarantees that Vodafone will want to sell its stake or that Verizon will pursue the plan. Vodafone declined to comment on the possibility of a Verizon bid for its stake or on the tax question. One person familiar with the situation said Vodafone cannot consider the size of any tax payout in a possible transaction until the company has received an offer, which it has not. Verizon hopes that if it structures a transaction to eliminate much of the tax bill, it can encourage Vodafone to come to the table for talks. Some analysts and investors say Verizon may have to pay as much as $130 billion to clinch the deal. The tax bill on a $100 billion deal, based on a simple acquisition of the stake, would be about $38 billion, according to UBS Investment Research. It could be much higher if the deal's price tag rises above that figure, UBS noted. That tax bill is based on the massive growth Verizon Wireless has experienced since it was established 13 years ago. The 45 percent stake that Verizon Communications wants to buy is owned by Vodafone Americas, a U.S. holding company. Given it is a U.S. entity, if Vodafone Americas were to sell that stake outright it would have to pay the full capital gains tax on the stake. But the sources said Verizon Communications is contemplating a two-part deal that could avoid this. Instead of buying the stake outright, the sources said, Verizon Communications would buy the Delaware-based Vodafone Americas. The seller of Vodafone Americas would not be a U.S.-based entity, so no U.S. capital gains tax would be due, said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting expert and author of the Willens Report. Vodafone's international structure is complicated, involving many holding companies, and the precise ownership of some assets is unclear. Vodafone Americas also owns some of Vodafone's non-U.S. assets, the sources said, probably including some in Germany and Spain. These would be sold back to Vodafone by Verizon Communications, which would keep the Verizon Wireless stake, they said. While the sale of the Verizon Wireless stake would not incur capital gains tax, the sale of the international assets back to Vodafone would. This is because it would involve the sale of assets by Verizon Communications, a U.S. entity. Compared with Verizon Wireless, the smaller international assets are thought to have gained little in value. Analysts estimated their sale could hit Verizon Communications with a U.S. tax bill of about $5 billion or less. The sources said that Verizon would seek to pass any tax hit on to Vodafone in the two-part transaction. Verizon has long coveted its partner Vodafone's stake in the Verizon Wireless joint venture, which started operations in 2000. The last time the two came close to a deal was in 2004, when Vodafone bid for ATandT Wireless. The British company, the world's second-largest mobile operator, however, lost that bid to Cingular and has since held on to the Verizon Wireless stake for its exposure to the U.S. wireless market.</content>

		<content>Enstitute, an Alternative to College for a Digital Elite - NYTimes.com Enstitute does offer a semiformal curriculum, requiring eight hours a week on topics like finance, branding, computer programming and graphic design, as well as English, sociology, and history, the content of which comes largely from online courses. The fellows also receive writing assignments every six weeks; outside academics and experts edit and review the work for writing style and grammar. Many fellows choose a less technical track for their course work and study subjects like Japanese culture or the poetry of Keats. Based on their living arrangements, it would be easy to mistake the fellows for traditional college students. They share a large loft space at 11 Stone Street, near the southern tip of Manhattan. There are two to four beds to a room and three shared bathrooms, and the fellows share cleaning duties. Most socializing takes place in a sparsely decorated common space, and around a large banquet-type table. Dinners are usually prepared and eaten communally. Twice a week, established entrepreneurs come to dinner, give an informal talk and take questions. Perhaps the only giveaway that this isn’t a college dorm is that by Friday night, the apprentices are often too tired to go out. Full-time work is exhausting. Many of the fellows say they work upward of 40 hours a week. There is no overtime; the compensation package is a stipend, usually around $800 a month, with housing and food fully subsidized by Enstitute — a benefit being extended only to the program’s first class. Starting this September, the new batch of fellows will have to pay $1,500 in annual tuition, and their room and board will not be covered. Stipends, however, will be around $1,600 a month — and they will be paid overtime. The entrepreneurs cite various reasons for agreeing to take on an apprentice. “It’s an awesome value at a nominal cost,” says Ben Lerer, 31, a co-founder of the , a digital media site geared toward men; its apprentice is Ben Darr, 20. “We would hire Ben full time today,” says Mr. Lerer, who treats Mr. Darr to twice-weekly boxing sessions. (Enstitute strongly discourages employers from hiring the apprentice before the program is over.) Having an apprentice for a two years has other advantages for a business. “It takes three to four months before you trust an intern and before they are up to speed, and then the internship is over,” Mr. Lerer says. Ms. Mason, at Bitly, agreed to participate in the program because she has an intellectual interest in new models of education. “I moved from academia into start-ups, and I wish I had had a way to learn what I needed to be useful at a company,” says Ms. Mason, a former computer science professor at Johnson and Wales University in Providence, R.I. Beyond the fellows’ work, companies are eager to tap into the mind-set of 18- to 24-year-olds, a coveted demographic group. , is its head of quality assurance and manages a product plan, which involves ensuring that the app works properly for users across all their devices. “Kwame put together a whole presentation of how people in college would use Tracks, says the company’s founder, Vic Singh, 36. “He makes copy sound more casual, and that helps move the needle with the younger audience.” (Unlike most of the fellows, Mr. Henderson is a college graduate; he received a bachelor’s degree in marketing, with a minor in information technology, from Seton Hall in 2011. He enrolled in Enstitute as an alternative to attending an M.B.A. program, which would have cost $50,000 a year.) THE apprenticeships in this class focus on tech start-ups. For the next class, Enstitute will offer apprenticeships in digital advertising and nonprofit areas, placing fellows at places like Enstitute says it has raised around $300,000 in donations in the last year, and it plans to expand to a couple of more cities by fall 2014. Its founders want the nonprofit Enstitute to become a brand name like that of a top-flight university. But instead of getting a paper diploma, the fellows will graduate with a portfolio of skills they’ve acquired, business development deals they’ve closed, marketing materials they’ve created and products they’ve built, in addition to 5 to 10 recommendations. When the first Enstitute graduates enter the job market, some hiring managers might view the program skeptically, says , a management professor of at San Francisco State University who serves as a hiring consultant for technology companies. Many hiring managers still place a high premium on a college degree and will not even consider an applicant without one, he says. But many companies are having trouble filling positions requiring precisely the kind of knowledge that the apprentices are learning. Mr. Henderson plans to leave Tracks knowing how to ensure that a mobile app is ready for public release. Mr. Darr learned how to wireframe, a way of making prototypes for screen-based products. Ms. Gao, who wants to run her own company, is learning Python, a coding language. Samman Chaudhary, 24, who wants to work at a business incubator, will have experience in evaluating business plans; she recently judged a “It’s a race for top talent, and you would be crazy to ignore talent that is demonstrating execution and learning through alternative channels,” says Jason Madhosingh, an Enstitute board member and director of innovation and digital partnerships at American Express, a role in which he makes hiring decisions. For many companies in technology hubs like Silicon Valley, San Francisco and New York, though, “this is exactly the kind of hire they are looking for,” Mr. Sullivan says. “Code speaks louder than words there.”</content>

		<content>Kimberly-Clark Benefits From Severe Flu Season - NYTimes.com , which makes Kleenex tissues, and the company raised its forecast for the year when it announced its results on Friday. In addition, Kimberly-Clark, whose shares closed at $106.10 on Friday, sold more of its Cottonelle toilet paper in the first quarter partly because of a supply problem at Georgia Pacific, maker of the Angel Soft and Quilted Northern brands. Georgia Pacific, which is privately held, said on Friday that the problem occurred at its Arkansas and Louisiana plants as they put in place $500 million in new papermaking technology. It said the work was having a short-term impact on its supply of Quilted Northern. Kimberly-Clark said the amount of Kleenex tissues it sold in North America rose by a low double-digit rate during the first quarter. A year earlier, when the flu season was weaker, Kleenex volume was down. Like its competitors, Kimberly-Clark has been looking to improve operations and cut costs. It is leaving some low-profit businesses in Europe and it has already restructured its pulp and tissue business. Kimberly-Clark, Procter and Gamble, Energizer Holdings and Colgate-Palmolive have all cut thousands of jobs as part of previously announced plans. $1.48 a share, well ahead of the analysts’ average forecast of $1.34, according to Thomson Reuters.

Sales rose 1.5 percent, to $5.32 billion, topping the analysts’ forecast for $5.28 billion. Kimberly-Clark said it expected to post 2013 earnings a share of $5.60 to $5.75, excluding items, versus its previous target of $5.50 to $5.65. The analysts’ average forecast is $5.59.</content>

		<content>Wells Fargo Kicks Off Bank Earnings - NYTimes.com Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools WELLS FARGO KICKS OFF BANK EARNINGS  |  Investors are gearing up for the latest round of bank earnings reports, after a sluggish year for Wall Street. Wells Fargo announces results at 8 a.m. with a conference call set for 10 a.m. Analysts are expecting fourth-quarter earnings of 89 cents a share, an improvement over the period a year earlier, amid signs that the housing market may be beginning a recovery. Still, Wells Fargo’s net interest margin, the difference between what the bank charges borrowers and pays depositors, has fallen in recent quarters. Up next are JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday, with Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley coming on Thursday. Banks put a number of legal battles behind them in the past year. This week’s $8.5 billion settlement over claims of foreclosures abuses is expected to show up in fourth-quarter results. FLAWED FORECLOSURE REVIEW ENDS; LENDERS WIN WIGGLE ROOM  |  The settlement this week with 10 big banks is “actually a way to quietly paper over a deeply flawed review of foreclosed loans across America,” The New York Times’s Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports. “To avoid criticism as the review stalled and consultants collected more than $1 billion in fees, the regulators, led by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, abandoned the effort after examining a sliver of nearly four million loans in foreclosure,” according to current and former regulators and consultants. “The examination was plagued by problems from its start in November 2011,” Ms. Silver-Greenberg reports. “Several former employees of a consulting firm doing reviews said that their managers showed bias toward the bank that hired them. Other reviewers said that the test questions used to evaluate each loan were indecipherable and in some cases the process failed to catch serious harm. Many borrowers said they had never heard of the review or were so baffled by the process that they gave up or dismissed it as just another empty promise.” New rules for mortgage lending were introduced on Thursday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which “made a few concessions to banks that consumers advocates say could leave borrowers vulnerable,” DealBook’s Peter Eavis writes. “Citing the ‘fragile state’ of the housing market, the bureau said it would allow new mortgages to meet more flexible standards for affordability during a phase-in period of up to seven years.” The concession affects a new product called the qualified mortgage, which will have to be more affordable for borrowers. “But the phase-in period will effectively allow banks to make qualified loans with higher debt burdens for up to seven years if the loans conform to standards set by government mortgage entities like Fannie Mae or the Federal Housing Administration. Such entities have reasonably high standards, but it is a loophole that banks could exploit.” FOR PREDICTING THE NEXT CRISIS, CRYSTAL BALL IS CLOUDY  |  The models regulators use to assess risk may be useful during normal times, but not when they matter the most, according to a new assessment from a little-known federal agency, the Office of Financial Research. Arguing that the models need to be fundamentally changed, the agency says conventional ways to measure risk fail to take interactions and feedback effects into account. “A crisis comes from the unleashing of a dynamic that is not reflected in the day-to-day variations of precrisis time,” Richard Bookstaber, a research principal at the agency, wrote. “Any benefits from such research is at least a few years away, however, and for now bank regulators are placing renewed emphasis on stress tests,” The New York Times columnist Floyd Norris writes. “Does the Fed have enough information to really know how the banks would fare if a new recession arrived? If Mr. Bookstaber is right, the answer may be that it does not.” ON THE AGENDA  |  Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, is on Bloomberg TV at 4 p.m. Jeff Rosenberg, BlackRock’s chief investment strategist for fixed income, is on CNBC at 1 p.m. Data on the international trade deficit for November is out at 8:30 a.m. HERBALIFE FIGHTS BACK  |  Herbalife sought on Thursday to counter accusations that the company was a fraud, with a two-and-a-half-hour presentation responding to criticism by the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman. But it appeared that investors were still making up their minds on the company’s rebuttal. After climbing as high as 7.6 percent in the morning, shares of Herbalife, a nutritional supplement company, declined 1.8 percent, to close at $39.24. Herbalife is a “legitimate company, with legitimate customers,” Michael O. Johnson, its chief executive, said. “Girl Scouts sell cookies on a direct-selling method, and nobody attacks them.” Mr. Ackman was not swayed by Herbalife’s defense, saying, “The company distorted, mischaracterized and outright ignored large portions of our presentation.” The hedge fund manager is “not just betting that the market will turn against Herbalife; he is going for the regulatory takedown,” Steven M.

		<content>Wall Street Closes Up on Tech Gains, SandP Near 1,600 - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks closed about 1 percent higher on Thursday, led by tech shares, after weekly jobless claims figures pointed to improving labor market conditions a day before the closely watched monthly payroll report. The European Central Bank also lifted sentiment, putting the SandP 500 at another all-time closing high, as the ECB cut interest rates for the first time in 10 months and held out the possibility of further action if necessary to boost the euro zone economy. The move follows Wednesday's Federal Reserve statement in which the Fed said it will continue its bond buying scheme to keep interest rates low and spur growth, and would step up purchases if needed. "This shows that central banks are very determined to ensure that the system is stable and that the global economy continues to be propped up if needed," said Weyman Gong, chief investment strategist at Signature in Norfolk, Virginia. "This makes us very comfortable with U.S. markets for the rest of the year." Jobless claims fell sharply in the latest week, dropping to their lowest since the early days of the 2007-09 recession. The data follows a string of underwhelming reports, including a slow rate of growth in factory activity in the U.S. and China, which added to concerns about the pace of growth going into the April jobs report. Analysts are looking for 145,000 jobs to have been added in the month, up from the 88,000 added in March. "U.S. markets are very focused on jobs, and the claims report suggests the positive trend of hiring could be continuing," said Gong, who helps oversee $2.5 billion. The Nasdaq advanced on strength large-cap tech shares like Apple Inc, which rose 1.4 percent to $445.52, and Amazon.com Inc, up 1.7 percent to $252.55. The PHLX semiconductor index rose 1.4 percent after earlier hitting its highest level in two years. Facebook Inc jumped 5.6 percent to $28.97 after posting strong mobile advertising revenue growth in the first quarter. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 130.63 points, or 0.89 percent, at 14,831.58. The Standard and Poor's 500 Index was up 14.87 points, or 0.94 percent, at 1,597.57. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 41.49 points, or 1.26 percent, at 3,340.62. The SandP ended at a record level and hit a record high intraday level of 1,598.58 earlier in the session. About 74 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher while 73 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares closed up. Visa rose 5.6 percent to $175.40 a day after reporting strong quarterly results and growth in the key U.S. market. The stock earlier advanced to an all-time high. General Motors rose 3.2 percent to $31.16 after reporting a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit as its North American business improved and its loss in Europe was smaller than Wall Street estimated. With 76 percent of the SandP 500 having reported, 68.5 percent have topped profit expectations, more than the 67 percent average over the past four quarters. However, only 45.6 percent have topped revenue expectations, below the 52 percent beat rate over the past year. After the market closed, American International Group Inc rose 2.6 percent to $43.22 after reporting its first-quarter results, while LinkedIn Corp slumped 11 percent after its results. Gilead Sciences shares jumped 4.1 percent to $52.18 after its combination hepatitis C pill proved effective in a small trial. Volume was light, with about 6.02 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, below the daily average so far this year of about 6.36 billion shares.</content>

		<content>Why Bad Directors Aren’t Thrown Out - NYTimes.com In the annals of shareholder democracy, it’s hard to imagine a more compelling case against a company’s directors than those who presided over the serial management calamities that have plagued the computer giant ¶ After ousting Mark Hurd as chief executive in 2010 amid messy accusations of sexual harassment, the board hired Léo Apotheker to replace him, even though Mr. Apotheker had been fired as chief of the European software giant SAP after just seven rocky months. Most of the board Mr. Apotheker, let alone ask him any probing questions about his tenure at SAP, before rubber-stamping the choice of the board’s four-member search committee. ¶ In 2011, H.P.’s directors unanimously approved the acquisition of the British software maker Autonomy for $11.1 billion, a deal that was considered wildly overpriced even at the time. Less than a year later, H.P. wrote off $8.8 billion of that and claimed it had been defrauded. (Autonomy officials have denied the allegations, which are being investigated by authorities in both the United States and Britain.) Some consider Autonomy to be the in business history. In the 2012 fiscal year, H.P. wrote off a total of $18 billion related to failed acquisitions and other missteps. ¶ With Mr. Apotheker at the helm and the board backing his strategic initiatives, H.P. announced that it was considering abandoning its giant personal computer business, then changed its mind. After Mr. Apotheker had been on the job a disastrous 11 months, the board demanded his resignation, and then paid him more than $13 million in termination benefits. Shareholders might have forgiven what Fortune magazine called a “tawdry reality show” if the stock had performed well. But from the time Mr. Apotheker was hired in September 2010 until he left in 2011, the stock went from more than $45 a share to a little more than $22. Despite a recent rally, shares are still below $24, even as the Dow Jones and Standard and Poor’s 500-stock indexes are hitting new highs. “You really couldn’t have a stronger case for removing directors,” Michael Garland, executive director for corporate governance in the New York City comptroller’s office, told me this week. “There’s been a long series of boardroom failures that have harmed the reputation of the company and repeatedly destroyed shareholder value over an extended period of time.” H.P. is hardly an isolated case. According to Patrick McGurn, special counsel for one of the major shareholder advisory services, Institutional Shareholder Services, shareholder efforts to remove directors in uncontested elections rarely succeed or come close, even in egregious circumstances. Last year, there were elections for 17,081 director nominees at United States corporations, according to the service. Only 61 of those nominees, or 0.36 percent, failed to get majority support. More than 86 percent of directors received 90 percent or more of the votes. Of the 61 directors who failed to get majority approval, only six actually stepped down or were asked to resign. Fifty-one are still in place, as of the most recent proxy filings. “People are calling them zombie directors,” Mr. McGurn said. But that hasn’t stopped them from serving on boards for what is typically lucrative compensation for relatively little work. (H.P.’s directors received a mix of cash and stock payments ranging from $292,000 to $380,000 in 2012. While the H.P. board has been largely reconstituted since the Apotheker debacle, all but one (Ralph Whitworth, a well-known value investor who joined in November 2011) approved the disastrous Autonomy deal. Raymond Lane, seen as an ally and supporter, at least initially, of Mr. Apotheker, was named chairman at the same time Mr. Apotheker took the helm. Working closely with Mr. Apotheker, Mr. Lane proposed five new directors. John Hammergren, chief of the McKesson Corporation, has been on the board for eight years, and G. Kennedy Thompson, chief of Wachovia before it was forced into a merger with Wells Fargo during the financial crisis, has been a board member for seven years. Mr. Hammergren was on the search committee that recommended Mr. Apotheker’s appointment. In its proxy materials, H.P. didn’t address the company’s record under these directors, but nonetheless recommended that shareholders vote for the entire slate, citing the risk of “destabilizing” the company by changing directors in an “abrupt and disorderly manner.” As to Mr. Lane, Mr. Hammergren and Mr. Thompson, it repeatedly cited their “experience” in running global companies, but said nothing about their roles in selecting Mr. Apotheker or other directors, the Autonomy acquisition, other failed strategic initiatives or, indeed, anything at all about their tenures at H.P. An earlier version of this article used outdated figures for the board’s compensation in 2012. The directors received a mix of cash and stock payments ranging from $292,000 to $380,000 in 2012, not $290,000 to $355,000, which was the payment range for 2011. The earlier version also misstated the compensation of Mr. Lane, the board chairman, for 2012. He received neither a cash award nor equities in 2012, though he received two large equity awards in 2011. The Common Sense column on Saturday, about the difficulty in removing poorly performing corporate directors, misidentified the group that follows up with letter-writing campaigns at companies where shareholders have voted disapproval of directors. It is the Council of Institutional Investors, not Institutional Shareholder Services.</content>

		<content>In Brown-Vitter Bill, a Banking Overhaul With Possible Teeth - NYTimes.com Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto AgencySenators David Vitter, left, and Sherrod Brown have introduced a bill that would require banks to set aside more capital to cover potential losses. The biggest banks have done an excellent job of delaying and undermining the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law and staving off criminal investigations into wrongdoing. Maybe, just maybe, they’ve been too successful. Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat from Ohio, and David Vitter, Republican from Louisiana, introduced a bill last week that calls for two things: making the giant banks much safer and tying regulators’ hands to prevent them from using taxpayer money to save a failing financial institution. The Trade View all posts Article Tools If the bankers who blew up the financial world had been held accountable, the popular fury that fuels this bill would have dissipated by now. And if Dodd-Frank were fully in place today, instead of being bogged down in the courts and in the halls of Washington regulatory offices, there would be no political momentum behind such an effort. Now, we will see whether the bill is simply a barbaric yawp of anger at the big banks or something with actual force. It probably won’t get passed, but its underlying premise cannot be dislodged from the Washington conversation. The Brown-Vitter bill calls for the banks with more than $500 billion in assets — I’m looking at you, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — to have capital reserves of 15 percent. That’s a much higher standard than exists today, especially because the current requirements have weak definitions of capital and total asset size. The banks have rounded up a bunch of critics, led by the likes of the law firm Davis Polk and Wardwell and the lobbying firm Hamilton Place Strategies, the volume of their lamentations most likely in direct proportion to the hourly rate they bill their clients. They invoke terrifying, talismanic statements: the bill is a “punishment” to big banks. It is simplistic, impossible, will render American banks “uncompetitive,” lead to financial crises and probably cause tooth decay. This naïve bill would force the giant banks to raise too much capital and would hurt the economy as the companies were forced to shrink or break up. Standard and Poor’s is one of the observers warning of a financial crisis. And who better to know than the people who brought us the last one? Goldman Sachs and S.and P. estimate the big banks might be forced to raise $1 trillion or more. That’s a lot, so much that the leviathans’ agents cry out that they couldn’t sell that much stock. But they don’t have to raise it all at once. And they can retain their earnings and stop paying dividends in addition to selling shares. In putting that argument forward, they don’t realize they make Senator Brown’s and Senator Vitter’s case for them. If investors are so terrified of the big banks that they won’t buy their stock, that’s a terrific problem. Most of the big banks trade below their net worth, an indication that investors don’t trust them. Brown-Vitter might actually help banks by restoring that trust. The Brown-Vitter bill serves as a good time to remind defenders of big banks what bank “capital” is. As Professors Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig have pointed out in their indispensable book “The Bankers’ New Clothes,” capital is not a rainy-day fund. It’s not stored away in a vault somewhere, never to be touched. Capital — the rest of us know it as “equity,” like the down payment on a house — is simply money that absorbs losses. The more money a bank raises from shareholders, the more profit it keeps on hand, the less it has to borrow and the more solid it is. The bank can still lend that money. And if JPMorgan Chase doesn’t lend to some small business, perhaps a regional or community bank will. There might be some trade-offs to higher capital requirements, but we know there are costs to lower ones: financial crises. Some try to argue that the banks faced a liquidity crisis in 2008, what we call a run on the bank. Yes, that was true in the autumn of 2008. But the crisis didn’t start then. It started in the late summer of 2007. If the banks had been more solidly capitalized, there would have been fewer panicked investors. Banks desire as little capital as they can get away with. It’s easier to make higher returns on equity with greater debt. Often management is paid in stock. But society as a whole doesn’t benefit from banks that are running with too much leverage. They collapse. So, it is better to have higher equity capital. But Brown-Vitter doesn’t go far enough. The bill’s definition of equity could be tighter. It still contains bookkeeping entries called intangible assets and deferred tax assets, which don’t absorb losses. But, gratifyingly, Brown-Vitter does tighten up the definition of assets. Capital is the numerator and assets are the denominator. Both need to be made as solid and trustworthy — and resistant to manipulation by banks or regulatory capture — as they can be. When calculating assets, Brown-Vitter tightens up rules on things like how the banks measure their exposure to derivatives. Oh, the critics shout, this is just a backdoor way of making banks smaller. The bill’s authors fail to understand that diversity of exposure saves gargantuan banks, they say. This requires a slap to the side of the head and a one-word rebuttal: Citigroup. Citi blew up because of its exposure to collateralized debt obligations. That exposure was dismissed and misunderstood by the top ranks because it was seemingly small as a portion of the bank’s balance sheet. It was wonderfully diversified into all kinds of investments, which didn’t help at all. Sure, small banks are less diverse. But when they collapse, the problem is more manageable. Brown-Vitter inhibits regulators from using risk-weighting of assets, where banks and regulators determine which kinds of investments are safe and require little capital behind them. Davis Polk declared that getting rid of risk-weighting is “too blunt,” somehow immune to the absurd spectacle of lawyers opining on proper risk management. In fact, risk-weighting has a storied history of blunder. Residential mortgages and sovereign debt, like that of, say, Greece, were once viewed as carrying little risk. Risk-weighting encourages banks to crowd into assets thought to be safe, in that way making them unsafe. It lulls them, and regulators, into a false sense of confidence. Perhaps throwing out risk-weighting might lead lots of banks to buy stuff that is known to carry risk. It’s far better to have them piling into investments that are known to be risky and count those purchases with a clearer, less manipulated number. Then, regulators need to pay attention, which, call me crazy, is their job. Brown-Vitter also ties regulators’ hands on whether they can pour taxpayer money into failing banks. Here, it’s less plausible. Dodd-Frank has given regulators resolution authority, which gives them the power to unwind failing institutions and impose losses on the shareholders and creditors. Brown-Vitter tries to eliminate what Dodd-Frank skeptics see as too much regulatory flexibility. It’s a noble idea. But the problem, as Paul A. Volcker has pointed out, is that if JPMorgan Chase is truly failing, it’s almost a certainty that Citi and Bank of America are going down, too. And taxpayers would then have to step in in some fashion. So, taxpayers are implicitly on the hook for the financial sector, even with Brown-Vitter. That’s why we need the biggest banks to have truly clear and understandable balance sheet fortresses.

		<content>Why Casey's General Stores Loves Iowa - NYTimes.com Article Tools Alimentation Couche-Tard’s hostile offer for Casey’s General Stores, a rival convenience store operator, would appear at first glance to be a plain vanilla hostile offer. Casey’s does not have a staggered board, so all of its directors are up for election this year. This provides Couche-Tard with a standard route for any hostile bid: it can begin a tender offer and combine it with the nomination of a slate of directors to bring the target to the table. In fact, this is what Couche-Tard has done. As we saw recently in the battle between Astellas Pharma and OSI Pharmaceuticals, this strategy can be quite effective, provided the price is compelling or competing bidders are absent. But there is a significant quirk here that allows Casey’s much more latitude to defend itself than would be normal. According to Factset Sharkrepellent, Casey’s is one of the 12 public companies incorporated in Iowa. This changes everything. About The Deal Professor Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the legal aspects of mergers, private equity and corporate governance. A former corporate lawyer at Shearman and Sterling, he is a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. He is the author of “Gods at War: Shotgun Takeovers, Government by Deal and the Private Equity Implosion,” which explores modern-day deals and deal-making. First off, unlike Delaware, Iowa has a constituency statute. This statute allows the Casey’s board to consider the following community interest factors when confronted with a takeover offer: a. The effects of the action on the corporation’s employees, suppliers, creditors, and customers. b. The effects of the action on the communities in which the corporation operates. c. The long-term as well as short-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may be best served by the continued independence of the corporation. Constituency statutes like these were enacted in many states after the 1980s Supreme Court decision in CTS v. Dynamics Corp., which validated second-generation antitakeover statutes. These statutes generally allow a board of directors to consider interests other than shareholders when deciding how to respond to a hostile takeover offer. The Iowa statue also provides that: If on the basis of the community interest factors described [above], the board of directors determines that a proposal or offer to acquire or merge the corporation is not in the best interests of the corporation, it may reject the proposal or offer. If the board of directors determines to reject any such proposal or offer, the board of directors has no obligation to facilitate, to remove any barriers to, or to refrain from impeding, the proposal or offer. This provision appears to provide Casey’s board with wide latitude to adopt takeover defenses and avoid the normal judicial scrutiny that would apply if it were incorporated in Delaware. In that state, the board’s conduct would be subject to scrutiny under the Unocal doctrine, which would require that its actions not be preclusive or coercive and be reasonable in relation to the threat posed. The Iowa statute appears to remove the board from the risk of review under such a higher standard, although the issue has yet to be considered by an Iowa court. Casey’s is certainly aware of its fortunate latitude. In its rejection of the Couche-Tard bid, Casey’s specifically set itself up to take such a position, stating that the Couche-Tard bid, if consummated: would have an adverse impact on Casey’s other constituencies, including employees, suppliers, creditors, customers and the communities in which Casey’s operates. So what could Casey’s do? Well, it certainly could take more standard 1980s-style defensive measures like a leveraged recapitalization. Couche-Tard has a financing condition in its bid, and this would work to fend Couche-Tard’s bid off. But you could also see a more aggressive stance like the adoption of a no-hand or dead-hand poison pill. These formulations would prevent Couche-Tard from seizing control even after it replaces the board. In the case of a no-hand poison pill, the pill remains in place for a set period of time thereafter; while the dead-hand poison pill is more aggressive and keeps the poison pill in place until its expiration, possibly years away. Casey’s could also adopt other types of poison, like contractual commitments to maintain operations and workers, that would hamper Couche-Tard in obtaining cost-savings in any acquisition. The lawyers can become quite creative — provided Casey’s board is willing — all in the name of the community. Given that Casey’s has mostly a retail shareholder base, the board may be more willing than usual since there is no strong shareholder force to oppose it. Still, there is one possible defense not available to the company. Casey’s cannot expand its board to dilute any Couche-Tard elected directors, since it is already at the maximum of nine directors allowed under its certificate of incorporation. In the meantime, Casey’s can also delay. Unlike Delaware, which requires the annual meeting to occur within 13 months of the last annual meeting meeting, Iowa requires that this meeting occur the earlier of six months after the end of Casey’s fiscal year or 15 months after its last annual meeting. Casey’s fiscal year ended April 30, so Casey’s can move back its annual meeting (currently scheduled for the third Friday in September) to as far as the end of October without risk of judicial challenge. And if it is willing to litigate, Casey’s can probably buy a month or two more. Iowa has also enacted a state registration requirement for tender offers (i) that seek to acquire greater than 10 percent of a company (ii) where at least 20 percent of such equity securities are held beneficially by residents of Iowa and (iii) where the target company has substantial assets in Iowa. Section 502.321B of the Iowa Uniform Securities Act requires the filing of a registration statement in such circumstances with the administrator of the Securities Bureau of the Insurance Division of the Iowa Commerce Department. If the disclosure in the registration statement is not sufficient, the administrator can suspend the tender offer and call a hearing on the matter. The timetable for this process — from suspension to a disposition at a hearing — is set in the statute to be 21 days from the filing of the tender offer registration statement. Moreover, any case must be brought by the administrator and cannot be brought by Casey’s. It is unclear if the statute applies — Couche-Tard did not say whether it did — but we will likely know in a few days whether this registration requirement is set off. I would not be surprised that if it is set off, Casey’s would claim that Couche-Tard’s disclosure is incomplete and lobby hard for the administrator to bring a case. Casey’s may also sue in federal court on the same issues to bring to bear such pressure. The Iowa disclosure requirements are not a deal breaker, but they could certainly tie up Couche-Tard. In defense, Couche-Tard will argue that this statute is pre-empted by the federal takeover laws, although a similar Minnesota law was upheld by the Eighth Circuit in Cardiff Acquisitions, Inc. v. Hatch back in the 1980s. On April 9, Couche-Tard sold most of its pre-announcement position in Casey’s, netting at least a $10 million profit. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that this move showed a lack of commitment by Couche-Tard’s. But we saw similar trading in the battle between CF Industries Holdings and Terra Industries. The amounts here are so small that no doubt Couche-Tard is simply pocketing money to finance its bid. The more cynical argument is that it announced the bid to make this money — which may have truth — but it seems a bit much for such a small profit. To the extent this type of trading activity encourages bids, it may not be a net loss for shareholders. Couche-Tard will ultimately need staying power as well as a compelling price. Depending upon how far Casey’s board is willing to go, it can erect substantial barriers to Couche-Tard’s offer. However, those arguments about other constituencies are likely to fade away if Couche-Tard is willing to pay. But in the near future, expect Casey’s to delay the holding of its annual meeting; it will likely take more aggressive defense steps in the fall only if it comes to that. This is perhaps yet another anecdotal illustration of the defensive benefits of incorporating outside of Delaware, benefits that may come at the expense of shareholders. – Steven M.

		<content>Oxy's Irani Gets Glass Lewis Nod After Recent Changes - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis has reversed its original recommendation for a vote against Occidental Petroleum Corp Executive Chairman Ray Irani after the company clarified its plans for Chief Executive Steve Chazen. Occidental, the fourth-largest U.S. oil company, had been forced earlier in the month to deny there was a "fight at the top" between the two long-serving executives. Glass Lewis had originally been concerned that the continued presence of 78-year-old Irani on the board as chairman would prevent Occidental from finding a replacement for Chazen, 66. But with Chazen, like Irani, now set to stay on until the end of 2014, that was no longer relevant, Glass Lewis said. On Monday, Occidental announced its plan for Chazen to say on as CEO, as well as changes to its governance and compensation programs. "Nevertheless, we believe shareholders should closely monitor the application of these policies, specifically as they may pertain to Mr. Irani," Glass Lewis said in an update on Tuesday to its previous recommendations for Occidental shareholders. , despite changes that include cutting the CEO's bonus to "no more than 20 percent" from 40 percent, and cutting the annual common stock grant to non-employee directors by at least 20 percent. Late on Monday, investor advisory firm ISS reaffirmed its recommendation to vote against Irani for the board but recommended a vote for the company's executive compensation plan, calling the new policies a move in a "positive direction."</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com Article Tools Greek Crisis Raises New Fears Over Credit-Default Swaps  |  Greece’s debt restructuring is dragging credit-default swaps back into the spotlight. The last time these instruments were on the global stage was in 2008, when the American International Group’s credit-default swaps helped bring the insurer, as well as the wider financial system, to the brink of collapse. A.I.G. had unique weaknesses, and regulators have started to overhaul the credit-default swap market since 2008. European policy makers have nonetheless looked warily at credit-default swaps, at least until recently, while they structured the Greek rescue over the last six months. They aimed for a voluntary debt exchange that would not initiate the default swaps, fearing that payments on the swaps might set off destabilizing chain reactions through Europe’s financial system. But now, with Europe’s $172 billion aid package for Greece, it appears that the nation is going to take a step that substantially increases the likelihood that its swaps take effect.

		<content>Filing Shows Twisting Path to Three-Way Race for Dell - NYTimes.com Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesA Dell computer for sale at an Electric Avenue store in Miami. Though the race for Dell Inc. has narrowed to three contestants, many more arose over a month ago. Advisers to Dell directors spoke to 71 potential bidders during a 45-day period aimed at finding alternatives to a $24.4 billion offer by Michael S. Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake, according to a securities filing by the company on Friday. The long-awaited proxy filing includes a lengthy history of the merger, detailing in 26 pages the negotiations that led to the Dell transaction. In particular, it shines a light on the 45-day “go shop” period, which ended last week with preliminary bids by the Blackstone Group and the billionaire Carl C. Icahn. Article Tools Related Links Document: The Dell proxy Timeline: How Michael Dell’s Takeover Bid Got Hatched What Dell Thought of Alternatives to the Silver Lake Proposal Dell is expected to point to the efforts recounted in the filing as proof that its board fought hard to find the best possible outcome for shareholders, as several investors continue to argue that the existing $13.65-a-share bid by Mr. Dell and Silver Lake is too low. According to the filing, bankers at Evercore Partners reached out to strategic and financial buyers starting soon after the deal with Mr. Dell was signed on Feb. 5. Several suitors were rejected because they were interested in only a piece of Dell’s businesses. On Feb. 6, Blackstone contacted Evercore, saying it wanted to participate in the go-shop process. The private equity giant had already expressed interest the previous month in potentially bidding for Dell. A month later, Blackstone and potential partners met with Mr. Dell to further discuss a bid. Other private equity shops emerged as well. The filing refers to a “Sponsor B” that held discussions with Dell directors late last year and was willing to take another look despite declining to bid the first time. People briefed on the matter identified that firm as TPG Capital. Ultimately, TPG decided again not to participate in any bids. A corporate bidder, identified as “Strategic Party A,” contacted Evercore on Feb. 8 to say it was interested in information about Dell’s financial services arm. That company — which people briefed on the matter said was General Electric’s GE Capital — later expressed interest in working with whatever group Blackstone convened to make a bid. At least three other strategic buyers sought access to Dell’s books. Most were denied because they appeared interested only in bidding for part of the company. Mr. Icahn first contacted Evercore on Feb. 26 about signing a confidentiality agreement. More than a week later, the billionaire wrote to the special committee, disclosing that he owned a “substantial” stake in Dell and warning that he would fight the proposed takeover by Mr. Dell. By the go-shop deadline of March 22, Evercore bankers had received three expressions of interest. One was from GE Capital, which proposed to buy Dell Financial Services only if combined with any takeover bid, including Mr. Dell’s. Blackstone also submitted an offer, now known to be over $14.25 a share, that would leave an unspecified portion of Dell public to let investors continue to own a piece of the company if they so wished. The firm disclosed that it was working with Francisco Partners and Insight Venture Partners. In a twist, however, Blackstone demanded that the Dell special committee reimburse the costs of assembling that rival bid, up to $25 million. That request was granted on Monday. Mr. Icahn offered to buy about 58.1 percent of the company for about $15.6 billion, or $15 a share. His proposal envisioned several major shareholders, including Southeastern Asset Management and T. Rowe Price, contributing their stakes as well. Privately, some Dell advisers considered Mr. Icahn’s proposal simply a placeholder to keep negotiating with the special committee, according to people briefed on the matter. He has said he is reviewing Blackstone’s offer as well, leaving the door open to joining that consortium.   A version of this article appeared in print on 03/30/2013, on page B3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Filing Shows Twisting Path To Three-Way Race for Dell.</content>

		<content>GMAC's Sweet Government Ride - NYTimes.com Article Tools The government bailout of GMAC is a complicated affair, probably the most intricate government bailout to date — at least until the inevitable future workouts of General Motors and Chrysler. The rescue of GMAC, which is G.M.’s financing arm, involves a debt exchange and cash offer, the reorganization of GMAC’s ownership structure, the partial severing of the exclusive G.M.-GMAC relationship, a government investment of up to $6 billion, and a redesignation of GMAC as a bank holding company, allowing it to tap into the aforementioned federal bailout funds via the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (or more particularly, the freshly minted Automotive Industry Financing Program). Like the bailout itself, this deal was never going to be pretty, but there are a number of things that taxpayers may find particularly irksome about this latest government action. 1. Easy Terms. The Treasury Department is investing $5 billion dollars into GMAC and in exchange receiving nonvoting, nonconvertible preferred interests in GMAC bearing 8 percent interest per annum. Treasury is also receiving warrants exercisable for a nonconvertible preferred interest on the same terms, except this preferred bears interest at 9 percent. The warrants are equivalent to 5 percent of the value of the $5 billion investment. Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the legal aspects of mergers, private equity and corporate governance. A former corporate attorney at Shearman and Sterling, he is a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law. His columns are available at The Deal Professor blog. Unlike other Treasury investments under the TARP, Treasury is not receiving warrants convertible into common equity of GMAC and so will receive no upside. Instead, the best Treasury can do on this deal is be paid back its investment plus interest. In addition, the 5 percent warrant value is below the 15 percent in value that other TARP recipients had to agree to and the program requirements specify. (See the specifications here.) Moreover, the value invested in GMAC appears to be disproportionate compared with what other financial institutions received relative to their bank deposit base. (GMAC bank has $33 billion in assets, according to the Federal Reserve.) The end result is that GMAC and its owners — Cerberus Capital Management, Cerberus’s limited partners and G.M. — will be able to receive the full benefit of any subsequent turnaround, with the government and taxpayer bearing the significant risk. 2. Ford’s Penalty. The day after the completion of the infusion, General Motors announced “Significant New Loan Financing as Low as 0% APR” and GMAC lowered its credit score for financing to 621, which is one point above what is generally considered a subprime loan. Both entities asserted that these new offers were made possible by the government bailout. Of course, the sales that G.M. reaps on the government’s financing subsidy will come at the expense of Ford and the transplant automakers. Notably, Ford has refused government funds so far and is now being penalized at taxpayer expense. How about them apples? 3. The SUV Sale. The list of cars for which G.M. is offering this special financing can be accessed here. Note that the best deals at 0 percent financing are for the 2008 Chevrolet TrailBlazer; GMC Envoy; and Saab 9-3, 9-5, 9-7X. The Trailblazer and GMC Envoy are SUVs, and Saabs are made abroad in Sweden. According to Yahoo’s auto Web site, the mile-per-gallon EPA rating for the Envoy SLE-1 4WD is 15 in the city, 21 on the highway. The rest of the list is loaded up with similar brands including the Hummer 2 and 3. This financing appears to be going to support sales of less-efficient gas vehicles and cars made outside the United States. I suppose that is fine, as this will clear out G.M.’s inventory in sales to relatively risky borrowers, but it can’t make the Democrats particularly happy — nor does it appear in line with the environmentalist credo G.M. was spouting at the second round of Congressional hearings. Of course, to the extent this clears out 2008 models for more gas-efficient 2009 models, this would be a benefit — though again beside the point of making G.M. profitable — but for this, we will have to wait and see. 4. Bank Holding Company Status. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, to be a bank holding company, a company must be “well capitalized” — this generally means that its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio must exceed 6 percent — and be “well managed.” GMAC was allowed to assume this status on an emergency, expedited basis. Make your own judgments on this one. 5. The Merkin Factor. By all public accounts, J. Ezra Merkin is still a member and chairman of the GMAC board. Mr. Merkin, as you may know, headed up Ascot Partners, a feeder fund to Bernie Madoff’s fund. Mr. Merkin was also supposedly responsible for Yeshiva University’s investment with Mr. Madoff and subsequent loss of $14.5 million ($110 million if you include the lost profits, but apparently, some inexplicably don’t.) Mr. Merkin at least has resigned from the board of Yeshiva University. Here, there was no word. In fairness to the government, I should point out that as part of this deal, G.M. and Cerberus will both partially divest their interests in GMAC in order to be below the 14.9 percent threshold set by the Bank Holding Company Act. Cerberus will reduce its interest to 14.9 percent of the voting shares and distribute the rest to investors; GM will transfer its interests above 10 percent of the voting shares to a trust with a trustee designated by the government and G.M., who will arrange for the G.M. interest to be sold within three years. Moreover, the board of GMAC is being reorganized by March 24, 2009, and then Cerberus will have only one board designee. The trust holding G.M.’s excess interest in GMAC will appoint two more managers, while one manager will be the GMAC chief executive and three seats will be independent, to be appointed by the other managers. So, Mr. Merkin is likely to yet go. This is the second time that Treasury has avoided taking a board seat and a measure of direct control, instead making appointments through a trust. Similarly, the appointees at American International Group are made by a trust for the benefit of Treasury. In both instances, this allows Treasury to keep the next administration from asserting direct control over these entities and maintains control with the management of the bailed-out entity in the case of GMAC. 6. Equity. In connection with the transaction, G.M. is investing up to another $1 billion in equity in GMAC. The money for this is coming from Treasury in the form of a loan at 3 percent over the greater of three-month LIBOR or 2 percent. This loan is securitized by G.M.’s interest in GMAC and nothing more. More risk for the government on this deal. Treasury’s GMAC bailout is yet another act in what David Zaring, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and I call “Regulation by Deal.” (Here’s an abstract of our article.) The government is approaching this bailout as a deal, with every transaction to be uniquely negotiated and ex post facto papered over with a new program. In fact, you can read the Treasury’s justification for the Citigroup bailout in its most recent program announced on Jan. 2, the Targeted Investment Program. According to the program’s terms, “Treasury will determine the form, terms, and conditions of any investment made pursuant to this program on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the considerations mandated in EESA.” This is the regulatory way of saying we can bailout whomever we want on the terms we deem appropriate. Part of this is the nature of the financial crisis, which in some measure necessitated an ad hoc response. But there are drawbacks here, as noted by Tyler Cowen, an economic professor at George Mason University, who commented on our concept of regulation by deal in a recent op-ed in The New York Times. The lack of consistency may have contributed to instability in the capital markets, though, as Eric Posner, a professor at the University of Chicago’s Law School, points out in this blog post, there may have been no choice, at least for the bailouts of financial institutions. Moreover, the auto industry bailout reflects the political nature of the TARP program. Initially, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. submitted a three-page bill that allowed him to purchase mortgage-related assets. Some members of Congress threw a hissy fit, describing this as a power grab, and then proceeded to give Mr. Paulson more power than he asked for. The final bill provided Treasury the power to purchase securities in any institution established and regulated under the laws of the United States or any state. At the time, I predicted that this large grant of discretion would result in bailout creep. And sure enough, here we are. With this ad hoc approach to the automakers, the government risks losing its objective for meaningful reform of these institutions. The interests involved (management, labor, dealers, suppliers) know full well that the government is increasingly all-in on an auto bailout. This will make gaining concessions from them more difficult and result in only partial reform at best. After all, why sacrifice when the government has said it will back you anyway? And here, the actions of the government belie its tough words. The government provided G.M. and Chrysler their money but will only assess their progress on Feb. 17, the date by which the automakers must submit their restructuring plans. It increasingly looks as if this will be a punt, and the automakers will not be able to achieve the goals expected of them under their loans. Instead, GMAC will be the first of a string of auto deals on kind terms, forgoing — at taxpayer expense — the hard choices the auto industry must make. That would be a shame and a loss for us all.</content>

		<content>Tyco to Merge Flow Unit With Pentair in All-Stock Deal - NYTimes.com Article Tools Related Links News release from Tyco International Tyco International agreed on Wednesday to merge its flow control unit with Pentair Inc. in an all-stock deal, creating a new powerhouse in the business of industrial pumps and valves. Under the terms of the deal, Tyco will proceed with its breakup plan, creating the flow business as an independent company. Pentair will then immediately merge with the new stand-alone entity, in a deal giving Tyco shareholders 52.5 percent of the company and Pentair investors the remainder. Pentair will also assume about $275 million in debt of the flow business. The transaction values Tyco Flow Control at about $4.9 billion. Pentair has a market value of about $4 billion. The new company will keep the Pentair name, and will be led by that company’s chief executive, Randall J. Hogan. It will retain the Pentair board, though it will add two directors named by Tyco. The announcement comes six months after Tyco announced a plan to break itself into three companies, including further unwinding a once-sprawling empire rocked by the downfall of its former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski. Mr. Hogan said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that he first approached Tyco late last year about a potential merger, and that he and Tyco’s chief executive, Edward Breen, began negotiating a deal in January. Tyco’s plan always left room for the individual parts to be acquired. Analysts and bankers had considered its flow control business to be especially valuable, given its leading position in the market of creating valves and pumps for energy, mining and water companies. Tyco Flow has annual revenue of about $4 billion. After the deal, Pentair will keep its main headquarters in Switzerland, where Tyco is based, with its American offices in Minnesota. The new company will have about 30,000 employees, with half coming from each of its parents. “This will be a clear number one leader in this space, in a very fragmented industry,” Mr. Breen said. Investors appeared pleased by the proposal. Shares in Pentair leaped nearly 20 percent, to $48, in premarket trading. Shares in Tyco rose 3.1 percent, to $55.20. Tyco expects to complete its breakup plan, including the merger of its flow business with Pentair, by the end of September. The remaining businesses to emerge from Tyco are its ADT home alarm division and its commercial fire and security unit. But Mr. Breen told DealBook that the Pentair deal was born of unique circumstances — a buyer of almost the same size as the target, a tight strategic fit — and that mergers for the other business units are unlikely. “All the stars had to line up to make it work,” he said. Pentair was advised by Deutsche Bank and the law firms Cravath, Swaine and Moore and Foley and Lardner, while its board was advised by Greenhill and Company. Tyco was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firms Simpson Thacher and Bartlett and McDermott Will and Emery, while its board was advised by Lazard. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: March 28, 2012 An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a law firm involved in the deal. It is Simpson Thacher and Bartlett, not Simpson Thacher and Batlett.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com TOP STORIES Parent of American Airlines Files for Bankruptcy  |  The AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in an effort to reduce labor costs and shed its heavy debt burden. AMR was the last major airline company in the United States to file for Chapter 11. Analysts said that its reluctance to do so earlier had left it less nimble than many of its competitors. The company says it intends to operate a normal flight schedule throughout the bankruptcy process, as previous airlines have done, and does not expect the restructuring to affect its frequent flier programs. As of Sept. 30, AMR had $24.7 billion in assets and $29.6 billion in debt, according to a filing with the federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan.

The discovery could be the most significant breakthrough in a monthlong hunt for the missing funds. During MF Global’s last chaotic days, the brokerage firm overdrew an account at JPMorgan, according to another person close to the matter. Some investigators now believe the firm used customer funds to patch at least some of the hole, which would have been a significant breach of federal law. MF Global transferred the roughly $200 million in the days before the firm filed for bankruptcy, said the people, who requested anonymity because the investigation was incomplete.

		<content>Maverick Operator Digicel Takes on the Big Boys in Myanmar - NYTimes.com SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Cellular operator Digicel Group Ltd jumped into Myanmar early and big, hiring staff, funding local sports, negotiating land deals for thousands of cell tower sites and signing up hundreds of partners for retail outlets. The strategy helped propel it onto the shortlist for a mobile license in one of the world's last mobile frontiers, putting an operator that ranks 65th globally in terms of customers up against giants such as Vodafone Group Plc. Whether its strategy pays off or not, industry insiders say, Digicel, largely unknown outside the Caribbean and some Pacific islands, has shaken up a usually conservative industry. "They have been a disruptive force," said Roger Barlow, a Hong Kong-based telecommunications consultant who has worked in Asia for more than 25 years. "Some of the big guys tend to look down their noses at them but they shouldn't because they're becoming a credible player." Myanmar this month short-listed 12 consortia for two licenses it plans to grant foreign operators in late June. The government wants to expand mobile penetration from less than 4 percent to up to 80 percent by 2015-16. While Digicel is up against behemoths such as Vodafone, China Mobile Ltd and Telenor ASA, several other big players failed to make the list - among them South Korea's SK Telecom Co Ltd and Egypt's Orascom Telecom Holding SAE. It's a vindication of sorts for Digicel's long-term approach. Business development director Frank O'Carroll led the charge into Myanmar in 2009. In early 2012 he persuaded the company to commit funds to build a local brand and prepare the ground so that if it did get the go-ahead it could roll out a service in a matter of months. That entailed deploying hundreds of workers across the country to negotiate thousands of leases for base station sites, months before the government had even begun the tender process. "There's not one square inch of the country we haven't been in," O'Carroll said in an interview in Singapore. Its sponsorship of the national football federation has built brand awareness - of sorts. Lots of locals have heard of Digicel, O'Carroll said, though at least initially they were as likely to think it's a brand of battery as a cellphone operator. It's a strategy, he said, that Digicel has been pursuing in much smaller markets for more than a decade. "What we are doing in Myanmar is not unique to Myanmar," said O'Carroll. "The first country that Digicel as a company looked to get a license was Trinidad and Tobago. We did very the same thing. We were there, we leased the land, we rented local offices, we started a local team, sponsored big sports." Digicel has since set up shop in 31 markets, gaining 13 million customers. While none boasts a population above 10 million people, the company has taken on some major rivals, including America Movil SAB, Vodafone, Telefonica and Cable and Wireless. "I don't think there's any fantastic science to it, but I do think it's our ability to move fast because we're small, we don't have this complex machinery that takes months and months to make decisions," said Vanessa Slowey, Singapore-based CEO of Digicel Asia Pacific, in an interview. Making those decisions is Digicel owner Denis O'Brien, an Irish billionaire who first focused on small markets in the Caribbean after noticing that spectrum was being auctioned off in Jamaica. Eventually the Pacific beckoned. Telecoms executive David Borrill recalls meeting O'Brien in his office after three years working for the incumbent operator in Samoa. "He went straight over to his library and opened the biggest atlas he had, turned to the Pacific and said, 'Tell me about this, where would you put an office here?'" A few weeks later Borrill was back in Samoa, this time working for Digicel. The company bought out Telecom New Zealand's stake in the incumbent operator in 2006, and within six months had more than doubled its customer base.</content>

		<content>Real Estate Funds Are Helped by Hints of a Recovery - NYTimes.com THERE was much for investors to worry about in the second quarter, but at least real estate was far down the list. Several reports hinted at a recovery in this long-suffering category, and that helped real estate investment trusts — portfolios of various types of property, and traded on stock exchanges — to outperform, along with funds that focus on them. showed a 9.6 percent increase in sales of previously owned single-family homes in the 12 months through May and a 7.9 percent rise in prices. New-home sales rose 19.8 percent over the same period, Commercial property has been on an upswing, too. The most recent reading of an industry benchmark, the CoStar Commercial Repeat Sale Value-Weighted U.S. Composite Index, was 6.5 percent higher in April than it was a year earlier. The improvement is hardly conclusive evidence that the multiyear decline in real estate prices is over, but it was enough to produce a 2.8 percent gain in the Vanguard REIT Index , by far the largest portfolio of its kind, in the three months through June, while the average real estate in Morningstar’s database was up 3.5 percent. The Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index was down 3.3 percent during the period. Many advisers recommend real estate investment trusts, or REITs, as well as funds that hold them. They provide income when it’s hard to come by, these advisers say, as well as the prospect of growth from a market on the mend. But some worry that with profits still meager for developers and other property owners, valuations are excessive. “You’ve got a lot of people who need income, REITs are in good financial shape, and they have a lot of opportunities to pick up buildings on the cheap,” said Allan Flader, a in Phoenix. “On the other hand they are trading at rich prices. They’re not by any stretch inexpensive by historical standards.” In real estate, idiosyncratic accounting practices limit the usefulness of conventional valuation measures like price-to-earnings ratios. The preferred measure, the ratio of price to funds from operations, was recently about 18.5 for the average REIT, Mr. Flader said, versus a long-run average of 13. REITs have also been trading at about a 12 percent premium to net value of assets, well above the 3 percent average, he said. Investors seem willing to pay up for assets that yield 3.3 percent, as an average REIT does, when 10-year Treasuries yield much less and require locking up capital for that long, and bank deposits and money-market accounts pay next to nothing. Being none of the above, neither bonds nor stocks, adds to REITs’ appeal. “REITs are getting so much play in the marketplace because they’re a good bond alternative,” said Jeffrey Leventhal, a partner in Bethesda, Md., for the . “More important, they’re a diversifier in a portfolio because they move with bonds instead of stocks.” Mr. Flader also appreciates that aspect of REITs — and advocates a permanent presence for them in a stock portfolio. Five percent would be an average position, he said, but his valuation concerns and an expectation of a “choppy” rebound in real estate lead him to recommend a 4 percent holding now. Mr. Leventhal, who sees himself as “very favorable on commercial real estate,” suggests having 5 percent in REITs, double his usual allocation. He prefers actively managed mutual funds, partly since the REIT world is so diverse. Each trust tends to focus on one type of property, like apartments or retail, industrial or commercial buildings, including some with high profiles, literally and metaphorically, like  One Penn Plaza, in Midtown Manhattan, owned by Vornado Realty Trust. Some REITs are quite specific, owning only shopping malls, say, or storage facilities. This segmentation, Mr. Leventhal contends, gives knowledgeable managers an especially good chance to outperform. He likes funds including Robert Wherry, a Morningstar analyst who follows real estate funds, is agnostic about real estate prices and bases his recommendations on performance, cost and his view of management quality. His favorites include But for many investors, in his view, the Vanguard E.T.F. provides the best route into the sector. “It gives you the broadest possible exposure to the domestic U.S. real estate market,” Mr. Wherry said, adding that Vanguard funds also have relatively low costs. INVESTMENT advisers caution that the narrow focus of many REITs can make them poor choices for small investors who build their own portfolios. For those who want to give it a go, Morningstar has given favorable ratings to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, BioMed Realty Trust, Corporate Office Properties, DiamondRock Hospitality, Hospitality Properties and Ventas. Real estate analysts at Citi Investment Research gave positive ratings to some of the same: Alexandria, DiamondRock and Ventas. They judged Colonial Properties, Home Properties and Post Properties worth buying in the apartment sector and Kite Realty Group, Regency Centers, Retail Properties of America and Weingarten Realty among retailing REITs. Mr. Flader’s valuation concerns do not extend to REITs that specialize in foreign property. They trade at discounts to their net asset values of about 5 percent and yield about half a percentage point more than American REITs. That makes them worthy portfolio additions, he said. He declined to name examples, citing company policy. One way for domestic REITs to reach bargain valuations, of course, is for their prices to decline. Real estate bulls like Mr. Leventhal envision a second scenario. If he is right, the sector should continue to give investors one less thing to worry about. “There’s a significant ongoing recovery in both residential and commercial,” he said. “It’s a good idea to allocate dollars to it.” An article in the Mutual Funds Report, Part 2 of this section last Sunday, about real estate investment trusts, misstated the rating that Citi Investment Research gave to one REIT, Community Office Properties. It was a sell rating, not a buy. The article also misidentified the owner of the Empire State Building. It is Empire State Building Associates L.L.C., not ESB Trust.</content>

		<content>Oshkosh Rejects Icahn's Offer and Moves to Protect Itself - NYTimes.com Darren Hauck/ReutersA military vehicle passes by the Oshkosh plant in Wisconsin. The Oshkosh Corporation rejected Carl C. Icahn’s $3 billion unsolicited takeover bid on Friday, deeming it too low. The company, a truck maker based in Oshkosh, Wis., also adopted a poison pill to protect itself against further moves by the billionaire investor. The company’s board additionally called on investors not to participate in Mr. Icahn’s tender offer of $32.50 a share. “Our board of directors unanimously concluded that Mr. Icahn’s unsolicited, inadequate, highly conditional and opportunistic offer significantly undervalues Oshkosh and is not in the best interests of all Oshkosh shareholders,” Richard M. Donnelly, Oshkosh’s chairman, said in a statement. Article Tools Related Links Documents: Oshkosh press release Mr. Icahn, who owns a roughly 10 percent stake in Oshkosh, has been a persistent critic of the company for some time. He is seeking to build his stake above 50 percent and gain seats on the company’s board. The company is asking investors to put their faith in management’s own plan to improve its stock price, a strategy that includes spending cuts and divesting itself of lower-margin businesses. Mr. Icahn has called on Oshkosh to spin off a unit, JLG Industries, a construction equipment maker, to improve its value. But the company called such a move “ill advised.” Mark Lennihan/Associated PressCarl C. Icahn, the activist investor. In a letter to shareholders on Friday, Oshkosh added that Mr. Icahn tried last year to force a merger of the company with Navistar International, another truck maker. That transaction would have been disastrous, the Oshkosh board wrote, pointing to a steep plunge in Navistar’s stock price this year. “Where Mr. Icahn has offered flawed, contradictory, self-interested and unproductive proposals, the Oshkosh board and management team have outlined a clear strategy and are delivering upon it,” Mr. Donnelly and Charles L.

		<content>SMBC Nikko Bets on 'Abenomics', Plans First New Branches in Five Years - NYTimes.com TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SMBC Nikko Securities will expand its domestic retail branch network by more than 20 percent over the next three years as it bets that the new premier's economic policies will lift the stock market further, the head of the country's third-largest brokerage said. Tetsuya Kubo, who became president of the brokerage arm of banking group Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (SMFG) this month, said he wanted to open 25 new branches as part of an effort to increase retail client assets by one-third, to 30 trillion yen ($302 billion), by 2016. The aggressive shift in strategy for SMBC Nikko, which has 109 branches and has not opened a new one in five years, could also mean tougher competition for Nomura Holdings Inc and Daiwa Securities Group Inc, Japan's two largest securities firms which have about 180 and 120 branches, respectively. Kubo, 59, said there was a need to invest in the brokerage's retail network after years of tight cost controls under the previous owner Citigroup Inc, which sold the franchise, known as Nikko Cordial, to SMFG in 2009. "Nikko is strong in retail but for the past several years we didn't really put resources into branches and staff," Kubo, previously chief financial officer of SMFG, told Reuters in an interview last week. His comments were embargoed for release on Monday. "To be a winner over the long term there is a need to increase staff," Kubo said. Earlier this month, the company announced it would boost overall staffing by 600, to 8,600, under a three-year business plan. Kubo said he was confident that bold fiscal and monetary steps under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, aimed at pulling the economy out of deflation, would continue to push stock prices higher. He would not be surprised, he said, if the Nikkei stock average reached 16,000 by the end of 2013. That would be a gain of another 20 percent for the benchmark from its close on Friday at 13,316.48, after already rallying some 50 percent since Abe was tipped as a candidate for premier in mid-November. Kubo also noted a marked increase in interest from foreign investors during the final months of his tenure as the banking group's CFO, when the aggressive economic stimulus espoused under "Abenomics" set stocks rising and the yen tumbling. While it was normal to be called on by asset managers in charge of Japan, he also started to get requests for meetings from global managers of equity funds. "There was a different look in their eyes. They wanted to know what was happening in Japan, what had changed," he said. Japanese individuals, which park the bulk of their $15 trillion worth of savings in bank deposits and other low-yielding instruments, have been a particularly hard sell for Japanese stock brokers and asset managers. Memories still linger of the collapse of Japan's asset bubble two decades ago, which hit retail investors hard. Kubo sees SMBC Nikko's ties to its parent bank, which owns 100 percent of the broker, as a key advantage over independent securities firms such as Nomura and Daiwa in tapping the renewed retail investor interest in stocks. The brokerage has attracted 1 trillion yen in assets through referrals from SMFG bank clients since becoming part of Japan's third-largest banking group, Kubo said. Of the 7 trillion yen increase in retail assets the brokerage is targeting over the next three years, it hopes to capture another 1 trillion yen through such referrals from SMFG, which has 10 times the number of accounts as SMBC Nikko, he said.</content>

		<content>Coach Profit Beats Expectations - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (AP) — Coach Inc. reported fiscal third-quarter results Tuesday that beat Wall Street expectations as the luxury handbag maker saw sales increase in its flagship North American market, as well as overseas. The financial news came as Coach also announced that Reed Krakoff, its president and executive creative director, will not renew his contract when it expires in June 2014 so he can focus exclusively on his namesake brand. Coach is exploring strategic options for the Reed Krakoff brand, which may involve a sale to a group in which Krakoff would participate. Krakoff, known for helping to revitalize Coach as a luxury brand and pushing splashy advertising to attract younger customers, has been in that job for more than 16 years. Coach said it is seeking a successor. The news of Krakoff's plans comes two months after Coach's longtime CEO Lew Frankfort, who with Krakoff transformed what had been a small leather goods business into a global luxury brand, announced he will step aside next year. Victor Luis, who is head of international operations, will succeed Frankfort as CEO in January, the company announced February. Despite big changes at the top, Frankfort told The Associated Press Tuesday that he expects the transition to be seamless. Frankfort will remain as chairman and CEO until January, then will become executive chairman. The changes are happening as Coach is reinventing itself once again by fashioning itself as a lifestyle brand anchored in accessories. Investors sent shares up more than 11 percent, or $5.72, to $56.31. The stock closed Monday's regular session at $50.59, down nearly 9 percent since the start of the year. As part of its efforts to branch out to other products, Coach has been building its men's business, which is expected to double to more than $600 million this year. The company's new footwear assortment, which launched during March in over 170 stores in North America and 60 directly-operated stores internationally, has been well-received by shoppers, Frankfort said. In North America, revenue at stores open at least a year rose 1 percent. The metric is a key gauge of a retailer's health, because it measures growth by stripping out the impact of newly opened and closed locations. Total sales for the region rose 7 percent to $792 million. International sales rose 6 percent to $382 million, or 14 percent when stripping out the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In China, where the company now has 118 locations, sales rose 40 percent and sales at stores open at least a year rose at a "double-digit rate," the company said. The company said it reached an agreement to buy its partner's 50 percent interest in its business in the United Kingdom and Europe, with the transaction expected to close in July. For the quarter, Coach Inc. said it earned $238.9 million, or 84 cents per share. That's compared with $225 million, or 77 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts expected a profit of 80 cents per share on sales of $1.18 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.</content>

Federal prosecutors accused Bank of America of a fraud started by its Countrywide unit. Legal minutiae may give Bank of America a basis to fight the claims in a recent Justice Department lawsuit. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit last week seeking at least $1 billion in penalties against Bank of America for troubled loans sold to the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The government complaint focuses on a program to push out mortgages implemented by Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America acquired in July 2008. The program, referred to as the “High-Speed Swim Lane” or “the hustle,” was created to get mortgages approved by dropping a number of credit quality protections to speed up the approval process. The program began in 2007 after the subprime mortgage market collapsed, and Countrywide tried to prop up its loan volume by concentrating on higher-quality mortgages that met the underwriting requirements of Fannie and Freddie. White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools Related Links Tallying the Costs of Bank of America's Countrywide Nightmare (Oct. 25, 2012) According to the complaint, Countrywide did not disclose that “the hustle” eliminated many checks on the quality of the borrowers when it sold the loans to Fannie and Freddie. The Justice Department accuses Bank of America of continuing the program after it acquired Countrywide and claims that the bank has improperly fought taking back defaulted loans that should not have been sold to Fannie and Freddie. The complaint relies on two statutes in seeking penalties: the False Claims Act and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. The False Claims Act dates to the Civil War, when it was enacted to combat defective products supplied to the Union army. The law now allows a penalty of up to $11,000 and triple the amount of damages sustained by the government for submission of any “false or fraudulent claim for payment.” An important aspect of the act is that private individuals can serve as whistle-blowers by suing on behalf of the government in what is known as a qui tam action. A former vice president of Countrywide initially filed the suit against Bank of America, and if the case is successful he would be eligible to receive up to 30 percent of the government’s recovery. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act is of much more recent vintage, having been adopted in 1989 during the savings and loan crisis. It allows the government to recover civil penalties of up to $1 million for each violation of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes when it affects a federally insured financial institution. One potential problem that the Justice Department faces is proving that Countrywide’s sales of the mortgages to Fannie and Freddie constituted the submission of a “claim” to “an officer, employee or agent of the United States.” The statute requires that the recipient of the claim be an instrumentality of the federal government, which is very much an open question. Fannie and Freddie operated as for-profit enterprises until they were put into conservatorship overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in September 2008. While they were “government sponsored enterprises” created by Congress and subject to extensive regulatory oversight, they looked like any other private company with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The Justice Department’s complaint provides details of a few questionable mortgages sold by Countrywide as examples of the types of transactions that constituted fraudulent claims under the False Claims Act. The problem is that these transactions took place in 2007, before the federal takeover of the two companies. The financial crisis hit around the time Bank of America took control of Countrywide. As a result, Bank of America could argue that the statute does not apply to any sales to Fannie and Freddie before they were bailed out, and before then the law is uncertain concerning their status as instruments of the federal government. In Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., the Supreme Court found that Amtrak was an instrument of the federal government. The court found that it was created “by special law, for the furtherance of governmental objectives, and retains for itself permanent authority to appoint a majority of the directors of that corporation.” Like Amtrak, Congress created Fannie and Freddie, and they serve an important government purpose in maintaining the mortgage market. But shareholders elected a majority of the directors before the 2008 government takeover, and ownership of their shares was in private hands, with no direct federal control of the companies. Bank of America can point to a 1996 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in American Bankers Mortgage Corporation v. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation to support an argument that the two companies are not government instruments. In that case, a mortgage company sued Freddie Mac for violating its due process rights when it transferred loan servicing contracts to – of all companies – Countrywide Financial because of violations of Freddie’s guidelines. The appellate court rejected the claim that Freddie Mac was an arm of the federal government because shareholders elected 13 of its 18 directors and the government had far less control over its operations than it exercised at Amtrak. But there are also cases that have found the two companies to be government instruments for determining whether they are subject to state and local taxation or come under federal securities laws. The Justice Department is sure to point to these in support of its position that the False Claims Act applies to Fannie and Freddie. Bank of America can also challenge the claim for penalties under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act by arguing that Countrywide’s conduct falls outside the statute. The Justice Department complaint asserts that the troubled loans caused substantial losses at Fannie and Freddie, which in turn led to losses at a number of banks that bought securities sold by the two companies. This is essentially a trickle-down theory: Countrywide’s fraud prompted losses at Fannie and Freddie that then spread to other federally insured financial institutions. That is a broad reading of what constitutes “affecting,” and arguably means that any mail or wire fraud at a company whose shares are owned by a federally insured financial institution could trigger liability for civil penalties under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. Determining whether a financial institution has been affected usually requires some direct impact on a bank and not just that the fraud rippled through the financial system. An article for DealBook by Ben Protess described the many legal claims against Bank of America from its Countrywide acquisition that might cost it as much as $40 billion. The bank has already paid $2.5 billion to Fannie and Freddie for problematic loans Countrywide sold to them, and the latest lawsuit tries to pile on more penalties for those transactions. Bank of America can point to requirements for pursuing a case under both statutes to try to get the complaint dismissed and keep its costs down. Other banks that sold bad mortgages to Fannie and Freddie will certainly be watching closely to see whether they might face similar claims in the future. Peter J.

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com TOP STORIES Trial to Begin for Former UBS Trader Accused of Hiding Huge Loss  |  UBS will face the harsh glare of the spotlight again on Friday, as opening arguments begin in the trial of a former trader accused of hiding a multibillion-dollar loss at the investment bank. Kweku M. Adoboli, 32, the former trader, faces charges of false accounting and fraud in connection with a $2.3 billion loss at the bank. He has pleaded not guilty. “As uncomfortable as the entire trial will be for UBS, it will show us what the consequences are when misconduct occurs or when individuals do not take their responsibilities seriously,” the bank’s chief executive, Sergio P. Ermotti, said in an internal memo made public by the firm. UBS, which has struggled to regain its footing since the financial crisis, has been plagued by a number of scandals in recent years.DealBook » A Tax Tactic That’s Open to Question  |  Leaders of private equity firms use of carried interest to lower tax bills. While that maneuver has raised eyebrows, it is perfectly legal. However, there is a related tactic to avoid taxes that is used by some private equity firms, including Bain Capital, whose legality is less clear, Floyd Norris writes in The New York Times. “It concerns the management fees that sponsors of private equity funds, such as Bain Capital, are paid. Those fees are separate from the fund profits that the managers are able to treat as carried interest.” “Instead of paying ordinary income taxes on those fees, the partners and employees of the fund sponsors pay taxes at much lower capital gains rates. In fact, they do even better than that. In some cases, they defer paying those capital gains taxes for years, itself a substantial benefit,” he says. Some legal scholars say such a move is “not justified, and some private equity firms have not chosen to use it,” he says.High and Low Finance » DEAL NOTES Article Tools A Sigh of Relief in Europe  |  A court decision in Germany and a Dutch election this week, when combined with the European Central Bank’s decision to buy bonds, gave the feeling that “perhaps the worst is over in the euro crisis, at least for now,” The New York Times reports.

		<content>Sturm Ruger Looking at Freedom Group but Deal Unlikely - CEO - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Gunmaker Sturm Ruger and Co Inc said it was looking at the accounts of up-for-sale rival Freedom Group but said it was unlikely it would make a bid. Sturm Ruger Chief Executive Michael Fifer said Freedom could be an acquisition opportunity and his company was looking at their books but he expects a deal to be grossly overpriced. "I don't actually expect it to go a lot further than that," Fifer said at the company's annual meeting of stockholders on Tuesday. "We'll have to see what the pricing comes out." Cerberus has come under pressure from the public as well as investors in its funds to sell Freedom Group after an AR-15 type Bushmaster rifle manufactured by the company was used in last year's Newtown school massacre. Cerberus, owned by private equity mogul Stephen Feinberg, bought firearms maker Bushmaster in 2006 and later merged it with other gun companies to create the Freedom Group. "There are a lot of companies I would like to buy but they are not for sale. If there are any downturns and maybe the market overreacts, then something will become affordable. But as we stand here today, I don't see any meaningful acquisition opportunities," Fifer said at the meeting. Shares of Sturm Ruger, which has a market cap of about $1 billion, closed up marginally at $51.27 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The company reported record quarterly sales on Monday, boosted in part by fears that impending legislation could ban the manufacture of certain high capacity guns. Fifer said the company was searching for a manufacturing facility to develop new products and meet demand but would not spend on building one.</content>

		<content>Nation Rich in Land Draws Workers From One Rich in People - NYTimes.com “We have been through times of sunshine which were very beneficial,” President Vladimir V. Putin said in an interview with the Russian state-owned RT television released on Thursday. As host, Russia set the meeting agenda. Tellingly, given Russia’s bounty of land, Mr. Putin chose food security and agriculture as a top topic, in recognition of Russia’s large and growing role in exporting grain to developing nations. The Russian government has set a goal of increasing trade with China to $200 billion a year, from $80 billion in 2011. By comparison, trade between the United States and China was $503 billion in 2011, according to the Department of Commerce. Skeptics of further economic ties between Russia and China point to deep mistrust dating to border skirmishes fought along the Ussuri River in 1969 that froze all development for decades. The border, in fact, was only fully demarcated in 2009. Russians also harbor fears that broadening economic cooperation will lead to a wave of Chinese immigrants taking over sparsely populated territories, a concern heard in this village, too. “Why are these people here?” said Nadezhda A. Kolyesova, a saleswoman out for a stroll recently through Ostanino, a picturesque jumble of wooden homes overlooking a pond, birch forests and the Golden Land farm. After some contemplation, she conceded, “I suppose it’s all right, so long as they don’t enslave our children in the future.” The farm has a policy of giving free vegetables to any local who shows up, mostly older people. The Chinese workers live in makeshift dorms made of plywood and scrap lumber, and patronize the village store for cigarettes, vodka, sausage and ice cream. Once, a fight broke out between young Russian and Chinese men. No romances have been reported, but the consensus of several grandmothers at the local market was that, in fact, Russians and Chinese can live peaceably side by side in rural Russia. Today about 400,000 Chinese migrants live in Russia, making up only a tiny portion of all immigrants in the country, most of whom come from former Soviet states in Central Asia. Chinese migration could well increase, however. In past seasons, Golden Land, a farm created out of an empty field five years ago, obtained at least enough permits to work its greenhouses, though bureaucratic tangles in Russia’s temporary work visa program reduced the quota this year. Vladimir Balasanyan, a local from Ostanino who works as a manager at the farm, and in whose name the Chinese investor initially formulated the land title, said few Russians wanted farm jobs these days. “Our government wants our farmers to work,” he said. “But Russians don’t want to work on a farm.” The Chinese investor in Golden Land had traded for years in a market in the nearby city of Yekaterinburg, according to Mr. Balasanyan. He obtained the land by buying shares in a defunct collective farm from villagers. He now lives in Harbin and recruits farmhands for Golden Land by word of mouth in surrounding Chinese villages. The owner, Piao Chen Nan, pays a higher salary to the Chinese than they would earn at home. He can afford it because he earns more on the sale of tomatoes — a pound sells wholesale for about 25 cents in this part of Russia, compared with about 8 cents in northern China, Mr. Balasanyan said. In the late fall, workers set up iron stoves in the greenhouses, and through the first frosty nights, feed them with split birch firewood from the forest, extending the growing season for a few weeks. Inevitably, though, the Russian frost sets in and the Chinese leave, retracing their journey home along the trans-Siberian railway until the next season.</content>

		<content>Cerberus Kills $1.1 Billion Deal With Innkeepers - NYTimes.com 5:58 p.m. | Updated Cerberus Capital Management and the Chatham Lodging Trust announced on Monday that they had called off a $1.1 billion deal to buy out of bankruptcy 64 hotels owned by the Innkeepers USA Trust. In a brief statement, the two companies said the decision arose from a determination that Innkeepers had suffered a “material adverse change” in its operating performance. Cerberus and Chatham did not elaborate on what the so-called MAC was, but said it would probably have a prolonged negative effect on the company’s business. Article Tools Related Links The press release The two companies had agreed in May to buy the hotels from Innkeepers, which operated hotels for chains like Hilton and Marriott. It filed for bankruptcy in July 2010 after buckling under a debt load that arose from its sale to Apollo Global Management. In June, the federal judge overseeing Innkeeper’s bankruptcy case approved the sale, which was meant to lift the company out of Chapter 11 protection. Invoking a MAC has been relatively rare since the financial crisis. Several investment firms used MAC clauses in their deal agreements to walk away from leveraged buyouts reached during the private equity boom. Perhaps the most notable example was J.C. Flowers and Company’s bitter fight to walk away from its deal to buy the SLM Corporation, better known as Sallie Mae. In 2007, Cerberus tried to walk away from its $4 billion buyout of United Rentals — but in that case, it did not cite a MAC as a reason to cancel the deal. Instead, it said it would pay a $100 million breakup fee. United Rentals retaliated with a lawsuit in November that year, but was defeated in court and forced to let Cerberus withdraw from its commitment.</content>

		<content>Humana Raises Its Forecast as Profit Climbs 13% - NYTimes.com Advantage enrollment growth. Humana’s shares also touched a 52-week high Monday after it forecast a better 2012 than some analysts expected. 2012 earnings of $7.40 to $7.60 a share. Many analysts expected an initial forecast from the company of $7 a share or less, a Citigroup analyst, Carl McDonald, said in a research note. Health insurers have been helped the last several quarters by medical costs that have grown more slowly than expected. If that trend continues, the analyst said Humana earnings could top $9 a share next year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect, on average, that the insurer will deliver earnings of $7.79 a share next year. The price of Humana shares hit $86.70 Monday morning, while broader trading indexes fell. They closed at $84.89, up $4.54 or 5.7 percent. rule governing medical-loss ratios, which essentially measure the percentage of premiums insurers spend on care. The impact of that rule has turned out to be manageable, and insurers face no such uncertainties heading into 2012. For the third quarter, Humana earned $444.7 million, or $2.67 a share. That compares with earnings of $393.2 million, or $2.32 a share, in the same quarter last year. Revenue climbed 11 percent, to $9.3 billion. Adjusted income was $2.54 a share, which easily beat Wall Street expectations. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected, on average, earnings of $2.03 a share on $9.26 billion in revenue. Humana is one of the largest providers of Medicare Advantage plans, privately run versions of the government’s Medicare program. Medicare accounts for 64 percent of Humana’s revenue. The company said individual Medicare Advantage membership climbed 10 percent compared with last year’s quarter to 1.6 million people, mainly because of a successful enrollment season last fall. The insurer’s Medicare prescription drug coverage enrollment also jumped 47 percent, to 2.5 million people, helped by a low-cost drug plan it offered with Wal-Mart Stores. Humana became the latest in a series of big health insurers to raise 2011 forecasts this month, after UnitedHealth Group, WellPoint, and Cigna. Humana now expects 2011 earnings of $8.35 to $8.40 a share, which is up from previous guidance of $7.50 to $7.60 a share. Analysts expect $7.69 a share.</content>

		<content>Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class - NYTimes.com In part, Asia was attractive because the semiskilled workers there were cheaper. But that wasn’t driving Apple. For technology companies, the cost of labor is minimal compared with the expense of buying parts and managing supply chains that bring together components and services from hundreds of companies. For Mr. Cook, the focus on Asia “came down to two things,” said one former high-ranking Apple executive. Factories in Asia “can scale up and down faster” and “Asian supply chains have surpassed what’s in the U.S.” The result is that “we can’t compete at this point,” the executive said. For years, cellphone makers had avoided using glass because it required precision in cutting and grinding that was extremely difficult to achieve. Apple had already selected an American company, , to manufacture large panes of strengthened glass. But figuring out how to cut those panes into millions of iPhone screens required finding an empty cutting plant, hundreds of pieces of glass to use in experiments and an army of midlevel engineers. It would cost a fortune simply to prepare. When an Apple team visited, the Chinese plant’s owners were already constructing a new wing. “This is in case you give us the contract,” the manager said, according to a former Apple executive. The Chinese government had agreed to underwrite costs for numerous industries, and those subsidies had trickled down to the glass-cutting factory. It had a warehouse filled with glass samples available to Apple, free of charge. The owners made engineers available at almost no cost. They had built on-site dormitories so employees would be available 24 hours a day. “The entire supply chain is in China now,” said another former high-ranking Apple executive. “You need a thousand rubber gaskets? That’s the factory next door. You need a million screws? That factory is a block away. You need that screw made a little bit different? It will take three hours.” An eight-hour drive from that glass factory is a complex, known informally as Foxconn City, where the iPhone is assembled. To Apple executives, Foxconn City was further evidence that China could deliver workers — and diligence — that outpaced their American counterparts. The facility has 230,000 employees, many working six days a week, often spending up to 12 hours a day at the plant. Over a quarter of Foxconn’s work force lives in company barracks and many workers earn less than $17 a day. When one Apple executive arrived during a shift change, his car was stuck in a river of employees streaming past. “The scale is unimaginable,” he said. Foxconn employs nearly 300 guards to direct foot traffic so workers are not crushed in doorway bottlenecks. The facility’s central kitchen cooks an average of three tons of pork and 13 tons of rice a day. While factories are spotless, the air inside nearby teahouses is hazy with the smoke and stench of cigarettes. has dozens of facilities in Asia and Eastern Europe, and in Mexico and Brazil, and it assembles an estimated 40 percent of the world’s consumer electronics for customers like Amazon, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Nintendo, Nokia, Samsung and Sony. “They could hire 3,000 people overnight,” said Jennifer Rigoni, who was Apple’s worldwide supply demand manager until 2010, but declined to discuss specifics of her work. “What U.S. plant can find 3,000 people overnight and convince them to live in dorms?” In mid-2007, after a month of experimentation, Apple’s engineers finally perfected a method for cutting strengthened glass so it could be used in the iPhone’s screen. The first truckloads of cut glass arrived at Foxconn City in the dead of night, according to the former Apple executive. That’s when managers woke thousands of workers, who crawled into their uniforms — white and black shirts for men, red for women — and quickly lined up to assemble, by hand, the phones. Within three months, Apple had sold one million iPhones. Since then, Foxconn has assembled over 200 million more. An article on Sunday about the reasons iPhones are largely produced overseas omitted a passage immediately after the second continuation, from Page A22 to Page A23, in one edition. The full passage should have read: “Another critical advantage for Apple was that China provided engineers at a scale the United States could not match. Apple’s executives had estimated that about 8,700 industrial engineers were needed to oversee and guide the 200,000 assembly-line workers eventually involved in manufacturing iPhones. The company’s analysts had forecast it would take as long as nine months to find that many qualified engineers in the United States.”</content>

		<content>Carrefour's Brazilian Deal Founders - NYTimes.com Rich Press/Bloomberg NewsAn outlet of Carrefour, the giant French retailer, in Rio de Janeiro. The deal that was set to shake up the French and Brazilian supermarket sectors has effectively collapsed. The French retailer Carrefour said on Wednesday that, after the Brazilian state-owned bank BNDES withdrew support for a planned alliance with Grupo Pão de Açúcar, the transaction could not be pursued. Article Tools Related Links The press release “The conditions necessary to the completion of this proposal have not been met,” Carrefour said, although it did not definitively announce that all plans had been cancelled or that it would not try to finance the deal by other means. On Tuesday, Grupo Pão de Açúcar’s largest shareholder, the French retailer Casino Guichard-Perrachon, confirmed its opposition to the proposed partnership, and BNDES publicly withdrew its support later in the day. Together with the Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual, the BNDES private equity arm had committed itself to provide up to 2.5 billion euros in financing, but that was based on the assumption that the deal would be friendly. “The prerequisite for any participation of BNDESPar in this transaction was an understanding between all parties involved,” the bank said, referring to its private equity arm. According to local media, BNDES had come under pressure from the government to pull out after public resistance and Casino’s opposition turned Carrefour’s plans into a flash point. BTG Pactual, for its part, said it would temporarily “suspend the proposal, with the purpose of maintaining an open dialogue” about the transaction. The collapse of the deal has stifled Carrefour’s hopes to capitalize on the high-growth Brazilian market, a move it hoped would offset its stagnant sales at home. The company reported a 23 percent decline in first-quarter operating profit compared with the period a year earlier, although it insisted that those results would be turned around by the end of the year. The unraveling of the deal could also affect ties between Casino, which owns 43 percent of Grupo Pão de Açúcar, and the Brazilian company’s 74-year-old chairman, Abilio Diniz, who had instigated the aborted partnership with Carrefour, and was alone in not opposing the deal at Casino’s board meeting on Tuesday. Mr. Diniz’s father founded Grupo Pão de Açúcar, whose names translates roughly as Sugarloaf, and whose retail arm, Companhia Brasileira de Distribuiçao, was set to team up with Carrefour’s Brazilian operations. The company first became involved with Casino in 1999, which obtained joint control of Grupo Pão de Açúcar six years ago. Casino shares that control with the Diniz Group. Next year, Casino will be able to name the chairman of Wilkes, the holding company for Grupo Pão de Açúcar, and thus gain even more control.</content>

		<content>Bill Ackman and Steve Roth to Join J.C. Penney Board - NYTimes.com Daniel Acker/Bloomberg NewsWilliam A. Ackman joined forces with Steven Roth of Vornado Realty Trust to get board seats at J.C. Penney. Jin Lee/Bloomberg News The hedge fund manager William A. Ackman has placed a big bet on J.C. Penney. Now it appears that the retailer will let him have a say in how to fix it. Penney’s said Monday that it would name Mr. Ackman, the head of Pershing Square Capital Management, and Steven Roth, the chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, to its board, months after the two investors disclosed major stakes in the company. The move by Penney’s is meant to keep a civil relationship with the two as it tries to rebuild its business after a slowdown in consumer spending, especially among the middle-income customers that the company claims as its core. It also is another victory for activist investors, who have re-emerged as powerful forces aimed at shaking up companies in an effort to bolster lagging stock prices. In October, Pershing and Vornado disclosed ownership of nearly 27 percent of Penney’s stock, prompting the company to impose a shareholder rights plan to limit the size of any one investor’s stake. Mr. Ackman has already scored one victory in recent months: Fortune Brands, a producer of home, hardware and office products, golf equipment, as well as spirits and wine, announced in December that it planned to split itself up into its three component businesses — two months after the hedge fund manager announced that he had bought a big stake in that company. Penney’s chief executive, Myron E. Ullman III, said on Monday that letting Mr. Ackman and Mr. Roth join the board was a result of months of talks with the two investors. Soon after learning of the stock purchases by Pershing and Vornado, Mr. Ullman invited the two investors to Penney’s headquarters in Plano, Tex. He described subsequent talks as “constructive.” Article Tools For his part, Mr. Ackman offered tempered praise for J. C. Penney in an interview with CNBC. “It’s a great company, it’s a great brand, it’s been around for years,” he said. “But it has underperformed its peers.” Investors seemed to approve of Penney’s move. Shares in the retailer jumped more than 7 percent on Monday to $32.52, their highest level in nearly three weeks. Less than a month ago, Mr. Ackman and Mr. Roth asked for board seats although Mr. Ullman said they made no threat, like a proxy fight. Penney’s management took the request to the company’s directors, who agreed to expand the board to 13 members from 10. A third new director, to be suggested by Mr. Ackman and Mr. Roth, will be appointed later this year. “Their approach was very much a ‘take the high road’ one,” Mr. Ullman said. So far, neither executive has expressed interest in any sort of financial engineering, much like the complicated real estate transactions that Mr. Ackman had unsuccessfully urged for Target in 2009. In the past, analysts have responded negatively to Mr. Ackman’s appearance at a company, especially if there appeared to be the prospect of a complex real estate transaction. “It’s not about financial transactions, it’s about the core operating business,” Mr. Ullman said. “Their assumption is that we have a big opportunity for the consumer.” This month, the company announced a management shake-up, including the replacement of Robert B. Cavanaugh as chief financial officer with Michael P. Dastugue. It also reported a 3.7 percent year-over-year increase in holiday sales. Penney’s also said it would close more than two dozen stores, outlets and call centers as part of a growth initiative. Contours of the plan was devised before Mr. Ackman and Mr. Roth arrived, Mr. Ullman said, although both investors have signaled they support the effort. The company plans to announce further growth efforts on Feb. 25. Mr. Ullman said the retailer planned to open new locations as well, with an eye on opportunities in cities, although it still expects some potential sluggishness for its core customers.</content>

		<content>In Footnote, Carlyle Hints at Size of I.P.O. - NYTimes.com As investor hints go, a footnote in a regulatory filing is about as subtle as they come. On page 197 of its revised prospectus, the Carlyle Group, the large private equity firm, indicated that it might sell 10 percent of its shares in its initial public offering. Article Tools Related Links The press release The arcane, barely noticeable note, buried in a section about tax calculations, revealed that the private equity firm assumed its existing owners would own “approximately 90% of Carlyle Holdings I L.P.,” an investment fund, after the I.P.O. While the size of Carlyle’s offering has not been finalized, the filing provides a clue about the potential size of the total offering. Carlyle disclosed earlier that it intended to raise $100 million in its I.P.O., although that figure was used to calculate the registration fees and could ultimately change. Carlyle’s path to a public offering has been bumpy of late. In February, regulatory pressure led the firm to drop a controversial arbitration clause that would have prohibited most types of shareholder lawsuits. Despite the setbacks, Carlyle is pressing ahead, sending clever holiday videos to investors and reshaping its boardroom ahead of its public offering. Last month, the company added a number of nominees for outside directors, including Jay S. Fishman, chief executive of the Travelers Companies; Thomas S. Robertson, dean of the University of Pennsylvania‘s Wharton School; and Janet Hill, a former consultant and the mother of the pro basketball player Grant Hill. Executives, while mum on their I.P.O., have also been vocal on investment opportunities and political issues. At an industry conference in Berlin, David M. Rubenstein, Carlyle’s co-founder, extolled the potential deals in Europe, which has been ravaged by the sovereign debt crisis.</content>

		<content>Owners of New Republic Seek Sale or New Investors - NYTimes.com Brendan Smialowski for The New York TimesThe cover of the first issue of The New Republic. The owners of The New Republic, the nearly century-old magazine that helped define modern American liberalism, are considering selling the magazine or creating a strategic partnership with new investors, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. The publication, which has featured the writings of George Orwell, Virginia Wolff and Philip Roth, has struggled in recent years as the magazine industry grapples with the need to transform itself in the age of the Internet. The New Republic’s owners, who include Martin Peretz, the magazine’s longtime editor in chief, have hired the Blackstone Group to run the sales process, these people said. About a half-dozen potential suitors have held early conversations, including Jared Kushner, the owner of The New York Observer; Thomson Reuters; Yahoo; and Bloomberg L.P. Industry executives say other suitors could include The Washington Post Company, AOL‘s Huffington Post division and the Atlantic Media Company. It is also possible that an individual investor looking for a trophy asset and a voice in the political debate during an election year may be interested as well. For instance, Marc Andreessen, the wealthy venture capitalist, owns a stake in Talking Points Memo. Article Tools A main goal of the owners is to find a partner that can help invest in the magazine’s digital transformation, including by developing a more robust strategy for social networking and mobile applications. A sale would be yet another change in ownership for the magazine, whose influence has often outstripped its small circulation. (As of June 2009, the magazine had a circulation of just 53,485, according to BPA Worldwide.) The New Republic is owned by a consortium led by Laurence Grafstein, a longtime media banker at Lazard who once interned at the magazine. Others in the group include the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman and the real estate developer Michael Alter. The investor group teamed up with Mr. Peretz in 2009 to buy The New Republic back from CanWest Global Communications, a financially beleaguered Canadian publisher. Mr. Peretz had sold stakes in the magazine several times, beginning in 2001. Founded in 1914 by the political journalist Walter Lippmann, The New Republic has long been a part of the liberal movement, counting presidents as readers, including John F. Kennedy. Under Mr. Peretz’s editorship and ownership, it has drawn criticism not only from conservatives but also from other liberals dissatisfied with some of the magazine’s stances on issues like the Iraq war. In recent years, The New Republic has reduced its publication schedule to biweekly and redesigned its once-staid pages in an effort to modernize its look. It has also sought to find a successful digital strategy, including by charging readers to access some parts of its Web site and by introducing an iPad app.</content>

		<content>Morgan Stanley's Profit Beats Estimates - NYTimes.com Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools MORGAN STANLEY’S PROFIT BEATS ESTIMATES  |  Morgan Stanley reported a fourth-quarter profit of $481 million or 25 cents a share, including charges. Excluding one-time accounting charges, the firm had a profit of 45 cents a share, beating estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters of 27 cents a share. Revenue was $7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 23 percent from the period a year ago, when the firm reported a per-share loss of 15 cents. Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, James P. Gorman, said in a release on Friday that Morgan Stanley had reached a “pivot point” in its turnaround strategy. The conference call is at 10 a.m. ARMSTRONG’S BACKER SAYS HE WAS UNAWARE OF DOPING  |  Lance Armstrong’s confession that he repeatedly used performance-enhancing drugs has raised questions about Thomas Weisel, the financier who bankrolled Mr. Armstrong through his seven Tour de France victories. But Mr. Weisel, speaking to DealBook’s Susanne Craig in his first public comments on the matter, denied the accusations that he participated in a doping program. “I did not know until very recently that Lance Armstrong had engaged in doping while riding for the team,” he said. “Any allegation that I was aware of or condoned or supported doping by any team rider is false.” Mr. Weisel, a legend in the investment banking world, is accused of wrongdoing in a federal whistle-blower suit filed by Floyd Landis, a former teammate of Mr. Armstrong’s, that claims the banker and other team officials “engaged in a systematic program of doping.” In addition, “Mr. Armstrong, in hopes of mitigating his lifetime ban from Olympic sports, might implicate Mr. Weisel and other team owners, according to people briefed on the case,” Ms. Craig reports. But Mr. Weisel said he was cooperating with federal authorities and has testified he did not know about Mr. Armstrong’s activities. Still, Ms. Craig notes, “if he did not know about the team’s win-at-all costs approach, he should have, friends and rivals alike say.” DELL’S FINANCIAL EMPIRE  |  The firm that manages Michael S. Dell’s $16 billion fortune, MSD Capital, could play a role in a leveraged buyout of Dell, DealBook’s Peter Lattman writes. Started by Mr. Dell 15 years ago, the firm has “quietly built a reputation as one of the smartest investors on Wall Street,” with a portfolio of stocks, companies, real estate and timberland. It is among the more prominent of the so-called family offices, run by Glenn R. Fuhrman, formerly a managing director at Goldman Sachs, and John C. Phelan, who was once a principal at ESL Investments. MSD has been cast in a spotlight as the private equity firm Silver Lake discusses a buyout of Dell worth more than $20 billion. That such a deal is being contemplated illustrates Dell’s financial missteps over the years, the New York Times columnist Floyd Norris writes. “For most of its history, Dell appears to have followed advice from investment banks — advice that ill-served long-term shareholders to the benefit of corporate executives. The company paid out billions of dollars to buy back stock, and only last year began to distribute some of the money to shareholders who chose to stick with it rather than bail out.” A leveraged buyout, Mr. Norris says, “might have been unnecessary had the company paid more attention to its business, and less to financial engineering.” ON THE AGENDA  |  Financial and political leaders are converging on Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, which begins on Tuesday. General Electric and McMoRan Exploration report earnings before the market opens. James Gorman, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, is making the television rounds, with appearances on CNBC, on Bloomberg TV at 9 a.m. and on Fox Business Network at 3 p.m. John McAfee is scheduled to appear on CNBC at 2:30 p.m. FRESH OPTIMISM IN SPAIN  |  So far, the new year has been kind to the euro zone countries most in need of debt financing. The Spanish Treasury on Thursday sold 4.5 billion euros, or $5.9 billion, of debt, including bonds with a maturity of as much as 28 years, The New York Times reports. The average interest rate on the two-year bonds was 2.71 percent, down from 3.36 percent in December. The rate on the benchmark 10-year bond was 5.03 percent on Thursday, after spiking above 7 percent last year. “Optimism is the flavor of the day, but perhaps people are overoptimistic,” said Birgitte Olsen, fund manager at Bellevue Asset Management in Zurich. “We’ve now seen some car companies shift their production lines to Spain, but a lot more reforms and work need to be done to return to growth and job creation.”  |  Contact: @williamalden | E-mail Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.

		<content>Health Care REIT to Buy Sunrise Senior Living - NYTimes.com Andrew Councill for The New York TimesMark S. Ordan, chief of Sunrise Senior Living, at a residence in McLean, Va., in 2008. Health Care REIT Inc. agreed on Wednesday to buy Sunrise Senior Living for $844.6 million in cash, in a deal aimed at creating one of the biggest owners of nursing homes in the United States, Canada and Britain. Under the terms of the deal, Health Care REIT will pay $14.50 a share, 62 percent above Sunrise’s closing price on Tuesday. Nursing home operators have been a popular target for deal-making in recent years, as companies and private equity firms seek to take advantage of an aging populace. Article Tools Related Links Documents: Health Care REIT news release Documents: Sunrise Senior Living news release Through the deal, Health Care REIT will add 20 senior housing communities that Sunrise owns outright as well as an interest in joint ventures that control 105 additional properties. Most of the centers are aimed at the higher end of the market, and they are concentrated in markets like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and London. “We are very pleased that Sunrise, a leader in premier care to seniors, is becoming part of our portfolio,” George L. Chapman, Health Care REIT’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “There are few opportunities to acquire assets of this quality in a transaction of this scale.” Yet Sunrise has posted losses for four of the last five years, and lost $23.4 million last year. On a pro forma basis, which excludes charges related to investigations and restructuring costs, the company reported a $147 million gain for 2011. (The company settled an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into its financial reporting two years ago.) Health Care REIT, based in Toledo, Ohio, has been a fairly acquisitive buyer of late, making 22 takeover deals since the beginning of 2011, according to Standard and Poor’s Capital IQ. As of June 30, its portfolio included 1,010 properties in 46 states and Canada. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year, pending shareholder approval. If the takeover is not closed by Feb. 21 because of certain extension rights exercised by Health Care REIT, Sunrise shareholders will receive an additional, unspecified payout. Health Care REIT was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firms Arnold and Porter; Shumaker, Loop and Kendrick; and Sidley Austin. Sunrise was advised by Goldman Sachs, KeyBanc Capital Markets and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz.</content>

		<content>After Hurricane Sandy, Stock Exchanges Prepare to Open - NYTimes.com var data;function jsonSlideshowCallback(response)NYTD.options = new NYTD.embeddedSlideshowBuilder(NYTD.options); 8:30 p.m. | Updated Stacks of sandbags were still protecting the entrance to the New York Stock Exchange and Goldman Sachs on Tuesday. Pockets of the financial district in Lower Manhattan remained underwater. Electric power was shut off for parts of the surrounding neighborhood. But despite the damage from Hurricane Sandy, Wall Street is preparing to open for business on Wednesday. After closing the stock and bond markets for two days, the N.Y.S.E., Nasdaq and other trading platforms are set to resume normal operations, following nonstop meetings and extensive testing of their systems. Wall Street now faces a critical test. Article Tools Related Links Damage to the Financial District, as Viewed on Twitter The exchanges want to get up and running as soon as possible to serve their clients and show they can operate in difficult conditions. A long delay could frustrate investors and damage their image. “It’s incredibly important to open these markets,” said Miranda Mizen, director of equities research at TABB Group. “It says New York is open for business.” Hurricane Sandy Multimedia var _obj = new NYTMM.SlidingBColGallery($("NYTMM_Embed672"),190,126,chameleonData); _obj.setFixedHeight(235); _obj.setPhotoData(chameleonData.photos); But a quick restart of trading might result in unexpected problems. If the exchanges open before they are truly ready, the markets might be vulnerable to complications that could ripple through the financial system. “You don’t want a false start,” said Matt Samelson, a principal at Woodbine Associates, a consultancy firm. “It’d be better to have everything in place before flicking on the switch and having a misstep.” Given the potential challenges from the storm, Wall Street has spent the last few days in emergency mode. The New York Exchange and Nasdaq said their systems are ready to resume operations. But some firms that trade on the exchanges continued to face problems in the aftermath of the storm. In preparation, the New York Exchange created an emergency response team, and roughly 30 staff members have been sleeping at the Lower Manhattan headquarters. On Tuesday afternoon, the exchange conducted trial runs with financial firms to detect potential bugs. Wall Street’s main trade group has been advising firms and exchanges. The group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, held one call with more than 400 regulators, exchange executives, traders and New York City officials. Federal authorities also weighed in. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, stranded in California by the storm, convened a phone conference with bank regulators to plan for assessing damage on Wall Street and preventing major issues from derailing trading. Throughout Tuesday, banks sent updates to regulators about their buildings, including any flooding and power outages. As the markets prepared to go back online, exchange officials and regulators braced for technical problems. The Securities and Exchange Commission spent much of Tuesday walking the exchanges through checklists that aim to detect potential mishaps. “Right now there are a lot of connectivity problems,” Larry Leibowitz, the chief operating officer of the NYSE Euronext, said Tuesday. Some trading firms with damaged data centers, he said, encountered problems connecting to the Big Board’s systems. One nearby building that houses several firms, Mr. Leibowitz said, sustained significant damage that could hamper their ability to operate. The industry is operating in relatively new territory. The last time the New York Stock Exchange closed for two consecutive days for weather-related reasons was 1888. After 9/11, the Big Board closed for four days. Regulators require financial firms to have detailed backup plans to deal with large disruptions like storms and terrorist attacks. Some market observers have been critical of the decision to close the stock markets, saying it shows these contingency plans failed. “The whole process was designed so that the exchanges would never have to close again like this,” said Chris Nagy, president of KOR Trading, which provides consulting to brokers and exchanges. On Tuesday, the scene around Wall Street was desolate. While the New York Exchange’s building appeared to be unscathed, many other offices in the vicinity were flooded. After an underground parking garage two blocks from the exchange was inundated with water, several cars floated to street level. Two Citigroup buildings were without power. The bank told employees in a memo on Tuesday that one of the buildings, 111 Wall Street, sustained “severe flooding and will be out of commission for several weeks.” Most major Wall Street firms have backup trading floors. They are often left empty for months on end. Employees are required to visit them regularly so they can be used on short notice. Some JPMorgan Chase employees outside New York City were working in central New Jersey. At the bank’s main trading floor in Midtown Manhattan, employees, many in jeans, shirts and rain boots, booked hotels for the night and discussed strategy. The bank, which sustained minimal damages at a building downtown, expected to resume normal operations in Midtown. Credit Suisse also planned to open for business on Wednesday, with its main offices by Madison Square Park running on backup power. The company has been providing buses and hotels for critical staff to work at the building, with other employees working from contingency centers in northern New Jersey and elsewhere in the metropolitan area. In downtown New York, Goldman Sachs was one of the few buildings with power. The firm has a generator in the event of outages, allowing its trading floors to continue to run. On Tuesday, televisions sets and lights inside the building were on, although few employees were there. One Goldman staff member who declined to give his name said he came to the office to charge his cellphone. In a memo to staff, Goldman announced its headquarters would be open on Wednesday. The firm also booked hotels in various locations to make sure employees could get to work. On Wall Street, the greatest relief came when the New York Exchange, the nerve center of the financial markets, announced that it was set to open both its electronic platform and its physical trading floor. The exchange has plans for the 200 or so floor traders to be in place. A number of traders and other exchange personnel live in areas where mass transit has been suspended, so the exchange has arranged cars for many people. Peter Costa, president of Empire Executions in New York, said he planned to be on the floor of the New York Exchange for Wednesday’s 9:30 a.m. opening. Mr. Costa, who lives on Long Island, is aiming to leave his home at 6 a.m. to make sure he is there in time. A number of his colleagues are making similar plans, with some car-pooling to work. Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities on the floor of the New York Exchange, wants to leave his house in Nassau County even earlier, around 4 a.m., in case of any technical glitches. “I want to make sure I get in plenty of time just in case something happens,” he said.

		<content>Can You Run a Company From Jail? - NYTimes.com Article Tools Peter J. Henning follows issues involving securities law and white-collar crime for DealBook’s White Collar Watch. The disclosure that the chief executive of the Horace Mann Educators Corporation, Louis G. Lower, is serving a 60-day sentence in a Florida county jail for a drunken-driving conviction caught everyone by surprise, apparently including the insurance company’s board of directors. It was not until almost a week after Mr. Lower started serving his term that investors learned of the conviction and that Horace Mann’s board placed him on leave and appointed its chief financial officer, Peter Heckman, to serve as interim chief executive. The timeliness of both Mr. Lower’s revelation to the board of his “situation” — as Horace Mann referred to it in its news release — and the company’s own disclosure to shareholders raises concerns about the timing of corporate disclosure to shareholders when personal matters of a chief executive intrude on the corporate business. This is not the first time a sitting chief executive has been sentenced for conduct unrelated to the company. Martha Stewart was convicted in 2004 on false statement charges, and she stepped down as chief executive of her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, and became chief editorial and media officer instead. In Mr. Lower’s case, it appears that while he told some executives at Horace Mann about his legal problem, the board was kept in the dark about the pending court proceeding in Indian River County, Fla., for an accident that occurred in late May. He pleaded no contest on Sept. 8 to a misdemeanor driving under the influence charge and was ordered to begin immediately serving his 60-day sentence in the county jail. It may be that Mr. Lower was surprised that he was being sent to the county jail right away and that he might have hoped to receive probation because he was a first-time offender or be given time before turning himself in to serve his term. I am not familiar with the practice in the local Florida courts, but I expect his lawyer informed him of the array of possible outcomes after the hearing so that he was prepared for any contingency. Horace Mann’s news release does not state when Mr. Lower informed the board of his situation. Still, it is certainly impossible to run a large insurance company from a Florida jail. It is not clear whether Mr. Lower thought that his absence from the company, which has its headquarters in Illinois, might not be noticed, but an executive facing any potential for incarceration has a fiduciary obligation to disclose that possibility to the board in advance of the legal proceeding. By not informing Horace Mann’s board of his situation, Mr. Lower appears to have made it impossible for the company to plan for his absence, and instead, it was left to scramble for a solution by quickly appointing the chief financial officer to fill in as chief executive on an interim basis. Once Mr. Lower was sentenced, it is not clear when the board learned of it, and a delay in providing that information would raise concerns about Horace Mann’s internal reporting procedures. It would be hard to assert that the chief executive’s absence for almost two months to serve a jail term is something that could just be passed along to the board at its next regular meeting like quarterly sales numbers. The corporate disclosure rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission require a company to inform investors when an executive retires, resigns or is terminated, and most companies view a leave of absence by an executive as the functional equivalent of those events and therefore disclose that information. But it is much more of a gray area for disclosure when the board learns of a potential problem before the person actually leaves the executive position. There was a controversy in January 2009 when Apple disclosed that its chief executive, Steven Jobs, would be taking a six-month leave of absence for a medical condition that later resulted in his receiving a liver transplant. The S.E.C. opened an informal investigation into whether the company should have disclosed his condition to shareholders early, when it first learned that he was suffering from medical problems. Nothing has come of the S.E.C. inquiry to this point, and I doubt there will ever be an enforcement action against Apple because the rules do not appear to require such disclosure, at least until the executive has decided to leave his position. Mr. Jobs’s medical condition was certainly personal — and very private — information, and it is questionable whether an executive is required to disclose to the board a personal issue when its impact on his performance is unknown. Once it becomes clear that there is a reasonable chance the situation will affect the person’s performance as chief executive, then the information becomes material to the board and investors. The test of materiality is quite broad, covering items that a reasonable investor would consider important in the total mix of corporate information. Unlike Mr. Jobs’s health problem, the drunken-driving prosecution of Mr. Lower presented a real possibility of some type of punishment that would make it impossible for him to attend to his corporate responsibilities, at least for a period of time. The criminal case is unrelated to Horace Mann’s business, but I think the potential incarceration of the chief executive makes this more than just a private concern and instead something that both the company and investors should be informed about. Once Horace Mann’s board learned of Mr. Lower’s incarceration, there is a good argument that it should have disclosed that information immediately to investors. As it was, the company did not release the information until after the market closed on Monday. The impact on the market from the disclosure was minimal, with Horace Mann’s stock price dropping moderately the next day before rebounding. But materiality is not defined solely by the effect on a company’s stock, and the issue is whether the board fulfilled its own disclosure obligation in a timely manner. The chairman of Horace Mann’s board stated in the company’s news release that in light of Mr. Lower’s “exemplary service in the Springfield [Ill.] and insurance communities, his contrition and acceptance of full responsibility for his actions, and the fact that this is his first offense, he will return to his C.E.O. responsibilities in late October or early November.” Mark V. Hurd, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, lost his job ostensibly for incomplete disclosure on reimbursement forms, with no allegation of any financial impropriety. Mr. Lower appears not to have informed his board that he had been charged with drunken driving and might be headed for jail in Florida, but that lack of disclosure does not appear to have put his job in jeopardy. For investors, the challenge is figuring out whether a company takes seriously its obligation to make timely disclosure of information. – Peter J.

		<content>Analysis - Court Ruling May Offer New Path in Market-Data Fee Dispute - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (Reuters) - At first blush the two leading U.S. stock exchanges won a sweeping victory this week in a long-running legal battle over market data - the stock quotes, share prices and other trading information that are highly prized in the electronic marketplace. But a ruling by the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia Circuit may also have opened the door for the Internet companies, brokers and others in the case to achieve a decade-old goal of cutting the fees the exchanges charge for the data. The court ruled in a decision earlier this week it had no jurisdiction over a case brought by the NetCoalition of some 20 Internet companies, including Google Inc and Yahoo Inc, and the Securities Industry and Finance Markets Association, a 600-member lobby for brokers, bankers and asset managers. The decision appeared to slam the door on the petitioners and remove a potential obstacle to efforts by the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market to offset sharp drops in revenue from stock transactions by boosting market data sales. But the court did offer a path for Sifma and the NetCoalition group to mount a new battle, several people close to the case said. The court indicated the Securities Exchange Act, which governs exchanges and their responsibilities as self-regulatory organizations, requires that the exchanges provide for the "equitable allocation" of reasonable fees, among other dues and charges. The petitioners have argued the exchanges are effectively monopolies and competition is not sufficient to restrain prices. "I intend to submit a ... petition," said Roger Blanc, a lawyer with Willkie Farr who represented the NetCoalition, the name by which the case is also called. "As soon as we can put it together, we'll be back before the circuit court." The case is notable because of the importance of market data in an electronic market that relies on "signal processing," the analysis of data by high-speed computers, to trade. Sifma and the NetCoalition had sought judicial review of the proprietary data both NYSE and Nasdaq sell after the Securities and Exchange Commission let stand almost all their filings for new schedules and higher prices for market data in recent years. The petitioners challenged the SEC over more than a dozen filings, saying the fees were exorbitant and regulators had abdicated their duties to ensure data fees were "fee and reasonable," a loosely defined standard the agency must uphold. Four of the complaints were combined before the appeals court, which has oversight of the SEC, and the two exchanges with the regulators provided a joint opinion in the case. Market data has been a thorn in the side of the SEC for years, with regulators unable to resolve the issue despite a series of high-profile hearings and studies from 1999 to 2005. Although the appeals court said the Dodd-Frank act stripped it of jurisdiction in the case, the court left intact its August 2010 ruling that there must be evidence that competition is constraining the fees the exchanges charge for the data. The court also said the exchanges cannot enforce fee rules that are inconsistent with the exchange act, and said fees need to be tied to "some type of cost-based" standard to guard against excessive profits. The latter point could be a boon for the petitioners' cause. They have long contended the cost of producing the data is negligible and the exchanges charge far in excess of its cost. "We are pleased that the court has affirmed our ability to provide high-quality data at reasonable rates to vendors who profit from reselling the data to their customers," a spokesman for the Nasdaq said. The NYSE declined to comment. The NYSE and Nasdaq presented academic studies to bolster their position that competition exists for market data, and they have strongly resisted any cost analysis of their data. The Nasdaq's chief financial officer has been telling analysts that market data is an "extremely high-margin" business. Revenue from the U.S. sale of proprietary data at the Nasdaq has expanded at a compound annual growth rate of about 10.8 percent since 2007, a period in which data usage has exploded. The emphasis on market data as a profit center is misplaced, according to former SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. The exchanges are trying to staunch their hemorrhaging and charging for data is purely a short-term solution to a long-term problem, he said. A good portion of market data is public and should not be proprietary as the exchanges see it, Pitt said in an interview before the court's ruling this week. Allowing data to be available only for those who can afford it will create hard-to-justify market dislocations, he warned. "The question is when you've allowed people to treat market data as proprietary for so long, how do you justify making a shift and what accommodations do you make?" Pitt said. The case is NetCoalition and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association v Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit; No. 10-1421.</content>

		<content>Investors Hope for Clarity, Quickly - NYTimes.com Jemal Countess/Getty Images for TimeVikram Pandit did not overhaul Citibank fast enough, or aggressively enough, in many investors’ eyes. As Michael L. Corbat takes up the reins at Citigroup, analysts and investors have a message for him: Shrink your bank fast, and be a lot more transparent as you do so. Mr. Corbat takes over from Vikram S. Pandit as chief executive of Citigroup four difficult years after the financial crisis. In that period, Mr. Pandit steadied the banking behemoth and tried to focus Citi on the businesses he felt it could do best in. But, increasingly, many investors felt Citi’s overhaul wasn’t bold or quick enough. “Citigroup has acted as if it’s too big to care,” said Mike Mayo, an analyst with CLSA, a brokerage firm. “That means that they are too big to be sensitive to shareholder concerns.” Article Tools Related Links Citigroup’s Chief Resigns His Post in Surprise Step Adept Moves in the Financial Crisis Helped Clear a Path to the Top Job Dissatisfaction with Citigroup’s progress motivated shareholders to vote against a $15 million pay package for Mr. Pandit in April. That vote came soon after the Federal Reserve turned down Citigroup’s plans to pay out capital to shareholders, a stinging indication that regulators still weren’t comfortable with the bank. Since those expressions of discontent, Citigroup’s shares are sharply higher, though they are still down 89 percent since Mr. Pandit took over in December 2007. The stock trades at a pitiful valuation, reflecting two dominant views in the markets: Citigroup’s transformation has a long way to go, and its financial statements can be opaque. The New York Times Though relatively unknown to shareholders, Mr. Corbat starts with a reputation as an assiduous executive with a deep knowledge of Citigroup, where he has worked for nearly 30 years. He even got good reviews from people who have been skeptical about Citigroup and its management. Sheila C. Bair, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who clashed with Mr. Pandit, knew Mr. Corbat from interactions during the financial crisis. “He was involved in several meetings with us,” said Ms. Bair, adding, “He was prepared and he knew his stuff.” Now, some analysts believe Mr. Corbat could open the door to more radical moves at Citigroup. “I think this is a real, long-term positive for Citi,” said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Still, Mr. Corbat may have to impress quickly, given the pent-up frustrations among shareholders. His first public conference call as chief executive on Tuesday was not encouraging on that front. He seemed to disappoint analysts who wanted to hear Mr. Corbat express a greater desire to change things. Instead, he said, “Today’s changes do not alter the strategic direction of Citi, which we believe is a good one.” In a memo to employees on Tuesday, Mr. Corbat sounded more emphatic. He wrote, “We must deliver sustained profitability, improved operating efficiency and shareholder returns.” Part of Mr. Corbat’s job will be getting more out of Citigroup’s best-performing operations. Many of its international lending businesses do consistently well, and he may look for ways to make sure investors give greater recognition to this strength. One idea may be to sell minority stakes in those operations in foreign stock markets, something that Spanish bank Santander has done recently with its Mexican unit. If those shares perform well, it would highlight the value in those businesses and perhaps lift Citigroup’s stock. Asked about this idea Tuesday, Mr. Corbat said, “I’ll look at those things and see what the numbers say.” The burning question, though, is whether he has the resolve to get out of businesses that the bank doesn’t excel in, even if the near-term costs are high. Mr. Cassidy, the analyst, said Mr. Corbat should sell any business line that could not achieve the sort of returns that shareholders expected. Citigroup’s chairman, Michael E. O’Neill, aggressively reduced the size of Bank of Hawaii when he led it. “He shrunk that bank by 30 percent; that’s what Citi has to do,” Mr. Cassidy said. In particular, some investors would like Citigroup to be quicker about selling assets in Citi Holdings, the bad bank that Citigroup set up for its unwanted and loss-making assets. Mr. Corbat ran Citi Holdings until the end of last year. Faster sales might mean Citigroup would not get the best price possible for the $171 billion in assets in Citi Holdings. That could lead to higher losses when sales took place. But selling assets more quickly could free up the capital the bank holds there. In turn, that could lead to a big improvement in Citigroup’s regulatory capital ratios, which investors watch very closely. Banks that can show they have little trouble meeting such ratios often get better valuations on their shares. Citigroup’s investment bank is the other obvious target for shrinkage. Right now, it is enormous. The “securities and banking” division at Citigroup has $903 billion of assets. That’s only slightly less than Goldman Sachs’s assets. And Citi’s investment bank’s revenue has been uneven since the financial crisis. The unit is also seen as a black box, something Mr. Corbat will have to tackle if he wants to regain investors’ confidence, analysts say. Citigroup’s disclosures aren’t as detailed as those of some other banks. For instance, each quarter, Goldman Sachs releases a critical number that shows how much profit it makes on its capital. But Citigroup doesn’t do that for its investment bank; it simply doesn’t tell outsiders how much capital it has deployed in that unit. As a result, it could be making unproductive investments in Wall Street operations without shareholders knowing. This could be true in other business lines, as well. The quandary for Mr. Corbat may be that, if he increases disclosure, investors may balk at any alarming numbers and dump the stock. Even so, he may have to risk that outcome. “They have to open up the kimono,” Mr. Cassidy said. Perhaps Mr. Corbat will become Citigroup’s quiet revolutionary, a leader who is prepared to make bold moves to win over, and win back, shareholders. He did offer up one button-down remark Tuesday that could provide a tidbit of hope to shareholders who are relying on him to redouble Citigroup’s remodeling. “I wouldn’t minimize the impact you can have on a place,” he said.

		<content>Temp Tee Urges Shoppers to ‘Whip’ Up Passover Dishes - NYTimes.com Decades ago, ads pitched Geritol tonic as the cure for “tired blood.” Now, a dairy product is being proposed as the antidote to “matzah fatigue.” Matzah fatigue could be classified as among “ problems,” the puzzles that perplex Jews who celebrate the eight-day holiday, which begins at sunset on Monday. It is a fanciful expression, to be sure, but it does address what is, for many, an issue each year: Around the third day, the palate often begins to rebel against a steady diet of foods that are kosher for Passover like matzah, the unleavened bread also known as matzo or matzoh. Enter the dairy product, Temp Tee, the whipped cream cheese sold by the Kraft Foods Group. A campaign that began this month, ahead of the start of Passover, declares that Temp Tee offers a culinary solution to the repetitious holiday regimen. The campaign, with a budget estimated at less than $100,000, is centered on a partnership between Temp Tee and Jamie Geller, an American-born Israeli food writer and chef who is the founder of the Kosher Media Network, known for its brand. Ms. Geller, who describes herself as “a lifelong devotee” of Temp Tee, is serving as the brand’s advocate among those who observe the holiday, offering them recipes and ideas for dairy dishes that are made with whipped cream cheese and are kosher for Passover. from the site — are raspberry macarons with cream cheese filling, salmon with shiitake mushroom and tomato cream cheese sauce, creamy colorful coleslaw roasted red pepper and arugula flatbread matzah pizza, sundried tomato and brie stuffed mushrooms, Passover cheese quiche and flourless cream cheese pound cake with passion fruit cream cheese ice cream. fan page on Facebook; comments on Twitter using the hashtag #matzahfatigue; and appearances by Ms. Geller at stores like Fairway. Appropriately enough for a campaign with so many elements that are in digital and social media, the work is being created by 360i in New York, a digital marketing agency that is part of the Dentsu Network division of Dentsu. The campaign is indicative of efforts by mainstream marketers to take advantage of the growing interest among consumers in foods that are or kosher for Passover. In the case of Kraft Foods and its predecessor companies, that interest dates to the days when Geritol was the treatment for tired blood. Perhaps the best-known example is the campaigns aimed at Jewish consumers for Maxwell House coffee, which began in 1923, and have been centered since 1932 on the publication of a Passover Haggadah, the book read at the Seder table to retell the story of Temp Tee was introduced in 1927, according to Kraft Foods, and was part of the Breakstone Brothers company, based in New York City, that Kraft Foods says was started in 1882. The National Dairy Products Corporation bought Breakstone in 1928 and two years later acquired what was then called Kraft-Phenix Cheese. (National Dairy became Kraftco in 1969 and Kraft in 1976.) The recent history of the Breakstone’s dairy products is a little complicated. The familiar pink eight-ounce tubs of Temp Tee no longer bear the Breakstone’s name; they now read “Uniquely New York since 1927.” (“New York” may have a double meaning, referring to Upstate New York, where Temp Tee is made at a Kraft Foods plant in Lowville, as well as the Big Apple.) The Breakstone’s trademark is licensed by Kraft Foods to a company called Dairy Farmers of America for Breakstone’s butter products. And although there were reports last fall that Kraft Foods was considering selling the Breakstone’s cottage cheese and sour cream business, packages of those products are still labeled as being made by Kraft Foods. In any event, Temp Tee and Breakstone’s products have long been popular with consumers in New York and the Eastern Seaboard as well as consumers. The connection between Temp Tee and Passover matzah is that because it is whipped, Temp Tee is easier to spread on each oh-so-crumbly matzah than regular cream cheeses like a Kraft Foods sibling, Philadelphia. “About 75 percent of the volume of Temp Tee is sold in the New York region, metro New York,” says Brant Wheaton, senior associate brand manager for Temp Tee at Kraft Foods in Glenview, Ill., with the rest concentrated in markets like Boston and Miami. And “20 percent of the volume” each year comes during the Jewish holidays of Passover and Yom Kippur, he adds. Temp Tee is “a little gem,” Mr. Wheaton says, a “niche brand” that he and other executives wanted to “do something a little more creative” with than conventional tacks like coupons or banner ads. That led to the idea of “digging in to try to understand what’s going on with Passover these days and how to be relevant,” he adds.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com TOP STORIES In Picking Facebook Shares, Repeating the Mistakes of the Past  |  Since the implosion of the dot-com bubble in 2000, retail investors have been rightfully wary of the stock market. Facebook was going to change it all, bringing the ordinary investor back, the Deal Professor writes. Instead, Facebook was a massacre for retail investors, highlighting yet again why stock picking is a loser’s game. The hype around Facebook was enormous as retail investors salivated at the chance to buy what they hoped would be the next Apple. Yet, after initially trading above $40 a share, the stock is now down nearly 43 percent from the initial offering price. The Facebook example is one more confirmation of studies that have shown that, on average, individual investors lose out consistently when they buy and trade individual stocks. They’re better off investing in passive index funds. Professors Brad M. Barber and Terrance Odean recently released a paper surveying the evidence. Studies of individual investor trading found that “many investors earn poor returns even before costs.” These investors trade badly and tend to lose more money than they would using a simple buy-and-hold strategy in passive funds that match indexes like the Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index.DealBook » Behind the Huge Facebook Loss at UBS  |  Like several other market-making firms, UBS lost money on Facebook’s botched initial public offering.

Icahn’s entire stake in the film studio for about $590 million, as preparation to eventually go public, a person briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. The move could help smooth the path for MGM to join the stock markets by providing an exit for a notoriously outspoken investor. Mr. Icahn bought into the film studio’s debt to try to force the company into a merger with Lionsgate Films, a campaign that failed. M.G.M. instead struck agreements with a number of creditors that allowed the company to file for a prepackaged bankruptcy, which shortened its stay in Chapter 11 protection. Under the terms of that filing, the film studio’s creditors essentially took control, making Mr. Icahn one of the company’s biggest shareholders. A spokeswoman for MGM declined to comment.DealBook » DEAL NOTES Article Tools A Call for Regulation, Not Breakups  |  Steven Rattner, a former Wall Street executive who also served in the Obama administration, writes in an op-ed piece in The New York Times that Sanford I.

		<content>Ruling Sets Up Pension Battle in Bankrupt City - NYTimes.com “The capital markets creditors contend that the city gave them a take-it-or-leave-it proposition, and that that is not negotiation,” Judge Klein said. “I’m sorry. I’m not persuaded. Negotiation is a two-way street. You can’t negotiate with a stone wall. You cannot do it. It cannot be done. It is a contradiction in terms.” Stockton’s city manager, Bob Deis, expressed satisfaction with Judge Klein’s decision in a written statement. “After nine months and millions of dollars in legal fees, the judge validated what we have been saying from the beginning, that the city is insolvent and needs the protection of bankruptcy to adjust its debts.” Calpers’ chief executive, Anne Stausboll, issued a statement saying that Stockton “has consistently acknowledged the importance of providing benefits to its employees through its existing relationship with Calpers, consistent with state law.” She said that Calpers would continue to act as a fiduciary as the bankruptcy progressed, “and protect and defend the integrity and soundness of the pension plan.” A spokesman for Assured Guaranty, Robert Tucker, said the company “respectfully disagrees” with Judge Klein’s decision on the question of eligibility. He said the insurer had made several proposals in mediation but Stockton did not yield. He said Assured Guaranty believed that “the real, substantive issues posed by the city’s Chapter 9 filing” would still be addressed, in the next phase of the case. Municipal finance specialists said one lesson they were drawing from Stockton’s case was that Chapter 9 was not as effective as it ought to be, given the scope of the city’s fiscal problems and how long it was taking Stockton just to bring Calpers, its biggest creditor, to the negotiating table. “You can’t restructure without dealing with your largest creditor,” said Karol K. Denniston, a lawyer with Schiff Hardin whose practice includes advising financially troubled municipalities in California. She said some members of the California state Legislature were already watching Stockton’s case and another in San Bernardino, with an eye toward new state laws that could help troubled cities avoid such expensive and debilitating struggles. “I think we’ll see legislation next year,” Ms. Denniston said. One idea being considered, she said, was amending the state pension laws, to give Calpers the authority, but not the obligation, to restructure the debts that distressed cities owe it.</content>

		<content>Big Oil Pursues Toreador Resources - NYTimes.com Article Tools Several big energy conglomerates are in initial discussions to buy or partner with the Toreador Resources Corporation, an independent oil and natural gas company that operates primarily in France, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. Three big companies — Royal Dutch Shell plc, BP plc and Statoil ASA — have signed confidentiality agreements with Toreador and concluded technical due diligence on the firm’s oil properties, these people said. Toreador currently has a market value of roughly $200 million. Representatives of Toreador and one of the three energy companies are in New York this week for meetings about how to structure a possible deal, these people said, but declined to provide the name of the company. Total S.A., the giant French energy company, has also conducted initial due diligence on Toreador but has backed away for now, these people said. In November, Toreador said it would explore strategic alternatives, including raising capital through equity or debt offerings, and a possible partnership in its primary asset, the Paris Basin oil shale. The company’s property on the Paris Basin is estimated to hold about 30 billion barrels of oil. Toreador has had conventional drilling in the basin for years, but hopes to begin a new technique, which uses high pressure water and sand and horizontal drilling to make it easier to extract the oil, in the third quarter this year. Toreador said at the time that it had set up a special board panel and hired RBC Capital Markets as its financial adviser. The company has decided to shelve plans for a debt or equity offering and has leaned toward a joint-venture or a full merger, the people briefed on the matter said.  Last year, Toreador took steps to strengthen its liquidity including, reducing debt, lowering costs, and selling its Turkish and Hungarian operations to focus on exploration of its French acreage. At the time, Toreador cautioned that there are no guarantees that the talks will result in any changes. A spokesman for the company declined to comment. – Zachery Kouwe</content>

		<content>Gasoline Brand Urges Drivers to Stop ‘Honkaholism’ - NYTimes.com Efforts by a leading gasoline brand to woo consumers in a nontraditional fashion are continuing with a light-hearted initiative aimed at discouraging a particularly annoying kind of vehicular noise pollution. The initiative, under way since early March, is sponsored by the 76 brand of gasoline sold by the Phillips 66 Company. It is part of a campaign that carries the theme “We’re on the driver’s side,” which began in 2009. The initiative, planned to continue through September, is being focused in three Western states where 76 is marketed: California, Oregon and Washington. Elements include a television commercial, billboards, a special Web site, social media, events and a promotional giveaway. The initiative is being produced by Venables Bell and Partners in San Francisco, which is the creative agency of record for 76 and the other gasoline brands sold by the Phillips 66 Company, Conoco and Phillips 66. The budget for the initiative is estimated at $5.5 million. The initiative urges drivers to stop “honkaholism” — the incessant beeping of car horns that bothers passengers, pedestrians and other drivers. It is styled like a public service campaign aimed at eradicating a societal ill, seeking to make people aware of the problem and then offering a solution. , as well as on television — starts with an angry man behind the wheel of a car at a crosswalk, is honking loudly as bewildered children stare. “Is your honking out of control?” a calm-voiced announcer asks. “You might be showing signs of honkaholism.” “Now you can put an end to all the beeping honking,” the announcer continues, “with the 76 Honk Suppressor.” The reference is to the giveaway item, a toy shaped like a hockey puck that bears a resemblance to the Easy button from the Staples retail chain. At the center of the Honk Suppressor, which can be attached to a dashboard, is a piece of red rubber or plastic bearing the 76 brand logo; when pressed down upon, it makes a bleating sound like a child’s doll or a dog’s squeaky toy. The Honk Suppressor is “the perfectly safe honking alternative,” the announcer declares, “designed to wean even the most beeping honkers off their beeping.” On screen, the angry man’s wife gives him a Honk Suppressor as he is driving off to work the next morning. Now he is a formerly angry man, poking his Honk Suppressor vigorously as an elderly woman slowly crosses the street in front of him. As the woman smiles and waves, an expression crosses the man’s face that seems to say, “I’m O.K. with this.” (The Honk Suppressor was originally available to anyone who filled out a request form at the special Web site, but has since been limited to drivers who live in the three Western states where the initiative is being concentrated.) Taking a stance against unnecessary horn-honking is another step toward helping “to put a more human face on” the 76 brand, says Tami Walker, manager for brand management at the Phillips 66 Company in Houston, as part of the “We’re on the driver’s side” campaign. (As for her repetitious title, Ms. Walker says, laughing, that she lives “in the land of redundancy.”) The genesis of the campaign was attitudes among drivers who “think all fuel brands are the same,” Ms. Walker says, or “don’t think much about fuel brands.” “As proud as we are to sell the top-tier fuels that we do,” she adds -- echoing a line from 76 ads about its status as “top-tier gas” — “the thing most valuable to us about the car is the person behind the wheel.”</content>

		<content>More Unknowns From Washington - NYTimes.com Morning Agenda View all posts Article Tools MORE UNKNOWNS FROM WASHINGTON  |  With investors already worried about the possible tax increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff, there’s another wild card that will factor into the debates in Washington in the coming months: the debt ceiling. A failure to raise the federal borrowing limit in a timely manner could send “financial markets into a panic,” writes Annie Lowrey in The New York Times. “Congressional leaders have made clear that the debt ceiling will be part of the intense negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff, with many members unwilling to raise the ceiling without a broader deal,” Ms. Lowrey says. Congress has some time to negotiate a deal before needing to raise the borrowing limit. But the experience last year showed that such high-stakes negotiations can hurt confidence. “Although bond yields remain low, when contentious political decisions — such as raising the debt ceiling — have come due in the past, uncertainty about the outcome led to unfavorable market reactions,” economists at the International Monetary Fund said in a global risk assessment. Political dynamics are shifting. For the housing market, that might not be a bad thing. “The best person to fundamentally change how housing works may be a president who won’t be running for office again,” who is willing to risk “angering many and creating a political firestorm,” writes DealBook’s Peter Eavis. The Obama administration faces a range of questions, like how to reduce the government’s role in the market, and how to decide which borrowers get the most subsidies, Mr. Eavis writes. Any overhaul will be fiercely challenged, as “so many people have benefited from the status quo.” The political wrangling may drag on for some time. The country has entered an “era of political brinkmanship,” in which lawmakers may “tiptoe back from disaster, with delaying mechanisms, before embarking on yet more brinkmanship,” writes Gillian Tett in a column in The Financial Times. Some lawmakers say they are working to strike an agreement in the postelection political atmosphere, reports Jonathan Weisman in The New York Times. And yet, there’s “no guarantee that they can reach an agreement after warring for two years.” KAYAK’S $1.8 BILLION DEAL  |  Kayak Software spent the summer as a public company, and now it is evolving again. The travel company, which had its I.P.O. in July, is being bought by Priceline.com, an older competitor, for $1.8 billion in cash and stock. The price of $40 a share represents a 29 percent premium over Kayak’s closing price of $31.04 a share on Thursday. Though the deal surprised some analysts, it could provide Priceline with a new source of revenue and help Kayak expand internationally. “I see Kayak serving as a global entree into the advertising market for Priceline,” said Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at the Benchmark Company. ON THE AGENDA  |  President Obama is scheduled to make a statement on the economy at 1:05 p.m. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase is on CNBC at 4 p.m. Sheila Bair, the former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is on Bloomberg TV at 5:10 p.m. J.C.

The daily deals company reported third-quarter revenue of $568.6 million, compared with $430.2 million in the quarter a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected revenue of $590 million. Shares fell as low as $3.21 in after-hours trading, after closing at $3.92 (and compared with an I.P.O. price last year of $20 a share). Europe has posed a particular challenge for Groupon, with the debt crisis hurting demand. The company said it had laid off about 80 employees. THE REGULATOR-POET  |  Writing rules for Wall Street doesn’t afford much opportunity for artistic license. Unless, that is, you’re Bart Chilton of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The muse was speaking to Mr. Chilton on Thursday, when he fired up two rounds of verbal fireworks in describing the process of putting the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul into effect. There was an airplane metaphor (“We’ve been waiting around the gate area, eating Cinnabons and watching cable news since July of 2010.”) and a football analogy (“It’s taken longer than some of us hoped at the kickoff, but now the goal line is in sight.”) WHAT ARE DEAL LAWYERS WORTH?  |  A new study suggests that “many of the legal minutiae” involved in mergers and acquisitions “are not worth it,” writes Reynolds Holding in Reuters Breakingviews. That conclusion is based on the finding that stock prices of target companies “remain essentially unchanged when contract details are disclosed.” DealBook’s Deal Professor, Steven M. Davidoff, challenged that argument. “It is quite clear that MandA terms matter. Just ask T-Mobile,” he wrote on Twitter.

		<content>Chinese Regulator’s Family Profited From Stake in Insurer - NYTimes.com SHANGHAI — Relatives of a top Chinese regulator profited enormously from the purchase of shares in a once-struggling insurance company that is now one of China’s biggest financial powerhouses, according to interviews and a review of regulatory filings. The regulator, Dai Xianglong, was the head of China’s central bank and also had oversight of the insurance industry in 2002, when a company his relatives helped control bought a big stake in that years later came to be worth billions of dollars. The insurer was drawing new investors ahead of a public stock offering after averting insolvency a few years earlier. With growing attention on the wealth amassed by families of the politically powerful in China, the investments of Mr. Dai’s relatives illustrate that the riches extend beyond the families of the political elites to the families of regulators with control of the country’s most important business and financial levers. Mr. Dai, an economist, has since left his post with the central bank and now manages the country’s $150 billion How much the relatives made in the deal is not known, but analysts say the activity raises further doubts about whether the capital markets are sufficiently regulated in China. Nicholas C. Howson, an expert in Chinese securities law at the University of Michigan Law School, said: “While not per se illegal or even evidence of corruption, these transactions feed into a problematic perception that is widespread in the P.R.C.: the relatives of China’s highest officials are given privileged access to pre-I.P.O. properties.” He was using the abbreviation for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. The company that bought the Ping An stake was controlled by a group of investment firms, including two set up by Mr. Dai’s son-in-law, Che Feng, as well as other firms associated with Mr. Che’s relatives and business associates, the regulatory filings show. , got the shares for an extremely good price, the records show, paying a small fraction of what a large British bank had paid per share just two months earlier. The company paid $55 million for its Ping An shares on Dec. 26, 2002. By 2007, the last time the value of the investment was made public, the shares were worth $3.1 billion. In its investigation, The New York Times found no indication that Mr. Dai had been aware of his relatives’ activities, or that any law had been broken. But the relatives appeared to have made a fortune by investing in financial services companies over which Mr. Dai had regulatory authority. In another instance, in November 2002, Dinghe acquired a big stake in Haitong Securities, a brokerage firm that also fell under Mr. Dai’s jurisdiction, according to the brokerage firm’s Shanghai prospectus. By 2007, just after Haitong’s public listing in Shanghai, those shares were worth about $1 billion, according to public filings. Later, between 2007 and 2010, Mr. Dai’s wife, Ke Yongzhen, was chairwoman on Haitong’s board of supervisors. Fund did not return phone calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Che, the son-in-law, denied by e-mail that he had ever held a stake in Ping An. The spokeswoman said another businessman had bought the Ping An shares and then, facing financial difficulties, sold them to a group that included Mr. Che’s friends and relatives, but not Mr. Che. The businessman “could not afford what he has created, so he had to sell his shares all at once,” the spokeswoman, Jenny Lau, wrote in an e-mail. The corporate records reviewed by The Times, however, show that Mr. Che, his relatives and longtime business associates set up a complex web of companies that effectively gave him and the others control of Dinghe Venture Capital, which made the investments in Ping An and Haitong Securities. The records show that one of the companies later nominated Mr. Che to serve on the Ping An board of supervisors. His term ran from 2006 to 2009. that another investment company had also bought shares in Ping An Insurance at an unusually low price on the same day in 2002 as Dinghe Venture Capital. That company, Tianjin Taihong, was later partly controlled by relatives of Prime Minister , then serving as vice premier with oversight of China’s financial institutions. In late 2007, the shares Taihong bought in Ping An were valued at $3.7 billion. The investments by Dinghe and Taihong are significant in part because by late 2002, Beijing regulators had granted Ping An an unusual waiver to rules that would have forced the insurer to sell off some divisions. Throughout the late 1990s, the company was fighting rules that would have required a breakup, a move that Ping An executives worried could lead to bankruptcy.</content>

		<content>UPS to Expand Natural-Gas Truck Fleet - NYTimes.com (LNG) vehicles and build four refueling stations by the end of 2014, as the logistics and courier services company ramps up its natural gas investments. UPS said that with natural gas prices 30-40 percent lower than imported diesel, and with U.S. production gearing up, it is investing more aggressively in natural gas infrastructure. Once the new project is completed, UPS will have one of the biggest LNG truck fleets in the world, the company said. Greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas trucks are about 20 percent lower than those of diesel trucks. That has been a talking point for the White House, but truckers say the cost of vehicles that run on the cheap and cleaner-burning fuel is still too high for a timely payback on such an investment. UPS said that, beyond favorable fuel cost and domestic resource access, the trucking industry cites 25 percent less carbon-dioxide emissions from using natural gas.</content>

		<content>Verizon Seen Having Clear Path to Funds for Vodafone Deal - NYTimes.com LONDON/NEW YORK, April 25 - Verizon would likely have little trouble rustling up $50 billion or more in the debt markets to help fund the full buyout of Verizon Wireless from UK partner Vodafone, bankers and analysts said on Thursday. Two sources told Reuters that Verizon Communications is mulling a 50:50 cash and stock bid of around $100 billion for the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless it does not already own. Demand for investment-grade debt is proving almost limitless in the current environment, and Verizon could expect a warm welcome from investors - even with such a large fund-raising. "Fifty billion dollars is certainly not impossible, especially if the company planned to take that out over the space of two to three years," said one London-based bond banker. Although Verizon's A3/A-/A ratings would almost surely be downgraded if the company re-leveraged to finance the buyout, it would likely still be strong enough to attract interest from institutional investors. "Verizon has already said it is happy to take a notch or two downgrade, so it already feels like they are warming up," said Patrick McCullagh, head of EMEA credit research at investment manager Schroders. "In an environment where pretty much every capital market is flooded with cheap liquidity, it is possible," he said. "The numbers do stack up. Debt financing has never been so cheap." A fund-raising of the size that Verizon might need for the buyout would likely involve a complex mix of loans, stocks and bonds, with the latter potentially issued across multiple currencies and maturities. No company has raised more in a dollar-only single bond deal than the $14.7 billion Abbott Laboratories spin-off AbbVie raised on November 5 last year. "One of the questions we often get asked is: how big is the market for one single offering?" the head of debt capital markets at a major Wall Street firm told IFR. "We tend to think that if you opened up every maturity and went to just the US market, that you could get about $20 billion to $25 billion done in a single deal," he said. Verizon is already one of the biggest corporate issuers of debt in the United States, with more than $50 billion of bonds outstanding in various currencies. "Ultimately, we believe it could raise ... $50 billion to $60 billion, but would require staggering issuance across at least a 12-24 month timeframe," Barclays credit strategist Danish Agboatwala wrote in a report last month. The company should also be able to take timely advantage of the red-hot state of the global bond markets. Roaring investor demand has pushed the costs for issuing debt down to near historic lows, meaning the ideal time to raise such a vast pile of cash is now rather than later. Yet Verizon's funding target could end up being significantly higher still, if Vodafone shareholders reject the $100 billion valuation of their stake in Verizon Wireless. Many in the market see the valuation as simply an opening gambit in negotiations over the long-mooted deal, with the actual selling price closer to an eventual $135 billion or so. "Valuation will need to climb much higher to create an outcome acceptable to (Vodafone) shareholders," UBS analysts said in a note to clients on Thursday morning. The higher price tag for the remaining stake in the biggest US mobile operator could mean more than doubling the debt burden for a company already carrying around some $52.9 billion of debt on its books. While that might make some investors think twice, many observers think that Verizon would have the ability to pay down much of the debt in relatively short order, especially given the positives of the US wireless operation. "We have a good degree of confidence in the strength of the wireless business," said John Culver, a senior telecoms strategist at Fitch Ratings. "We believe that Verizon would have the capacity to pay down a significant amount of debt in the short term," he said. A person familiar with the situation told Reuters that the two companies have previously held high-level talks to discuss how any deal could avoid incurring the tax. McCullagh from Schroders and a London-based fund manager each said that the best way to address the tax issue might be for Verizon simply to buy Vodafone altogether. "It would make more sense to buy all of the company and then spin off parts later on, than to pay over the odds for the wireless stake just to cover Vodafone's tax bill," McCullagh said.

		<content>For Corporate Boards, Lessons From JPMorgan's Trading Disaster - NYTimes.com Mark Lennihan/Associated PressJPMorgan Chase has announced several changes in its oversight since it disclosed a $6 billion trading loss. Michael W. Peregrine, a partner at the law firm McDermott Will and Emery, advises corporations, officers and directors on issues related to corporate governance, fiduciary duties and internal investigations. Last month, JPMorgan Chase released the internal analysis of the $6 billion loss in its synthetic credit portfolio in 2012. While the losses may seem as if they were aberrations that couldn’t happen elsewhere, the governance recommendations that were released as part of the internal analysis are highly relevant across corporate America, not just financial institutions. From the public’s perspective, the 129-page report written by a JPMorgan management task force – which focused on what happened, why it happened and who was to blame – was the most intriguing. But a shorter companion report prepared by a board review committee holds many lessons for corporate boards on risk oversight practices. The JPMorgan review of the trading loss concluded that the credit portfolio risks weren’t presented to the risk policy committee in a timely manner. Even though losses were beginning to mount at the bank, traders in London increased their trades over several months rather than exiting and cutting their losses, according to the report. Article Tools The full extent of the loss wasn’t communicated to the board’s risk committee until late April, shortly before the bank publicly announced the loss. Because of that delay, the committee wasn’t able to address the issue in its early stage and potentially limit its loss. It wasn’t a question of deficient governance, but rather one of deficient reporting. This was clearly not a case where the board was asleep at the wheel. Rather, the JPMorgan analysis suggested that if the board members had received the information fully and promptly, they would have been able to better exercise their oversight responsibility. JPMorgan’s recommendations deal directly with the kinds of “real world” reporting failures found in many corporate and nonprofit organizations. That starts with the need to present information that is useful to the risk committee, and in a manner and context that are meaningful to the committee. Issues that “keep management awake at night” need to be immediately brought to the committee’s attention. The higher the quality of materials, the more efficient the committee meeting process will be. In addition, the JPMorgan report highlights the need to re-examine the committee charter for clarity of scope and purpose. That would help prevent overlap and gaps in the duties of the various board committees (e.g., risk, audit and compliance). Such a review also extends to the need to coordinate the role of the internal auditor. The report adds to the mix an acknowledgment that audit and risk committee members have greater responsibilities and demands than their peers on many other committees do, as well as the indirect suggestion that the qualifications for committee membership must be particularly sterling. The reality of life in a highly regulated industry is reflected in the recommendation that the risk committee maintain, where appropriate, more frequent and informal contacts with regulators to better demonstrate the committee’s interest in understanding regulatory concerns. One of the most direct recommendations in the report relates to the independence of compliance and risk managers. An emerging view is that these managers should now report directly to the chief executive and not to a company’s general counsel. (Last month, JPMorgan said it had changed the chain of command so that its head of global compliance and regulatory management will report directly to the bank’s chief operating officers). Moreover, the title and compensation of compliance and risk officers should command the same heft and responsibility of the post. Also proposed is a greater link between executive compensation and satisfaction of the board’s risk reporting standards. With this episode, the JPMorgan board has placed a serious emphasis on the critical connection between information reporting and governance oversight. That process indeed counts, because a failure of process can seriously compromise the effectiveness of governance checks and balances. And the connection is made in the context of an extraordinary controversy involving huge corporate losses, reputational harm and regulatory inquiry. These were failures that are not unique to JPMorgan or to high finance, but can be found in any corporation, no matter the industry. JPMorgan’s situation will be fodder for business schools for years. But its more practical legacy may be decidedly nonfiction in nature — setting new standards for board oversight of operational risk. It provides a highly practical template for other boards, across industry lines, to replicate. Mr. Peregrine’s views do not necessarily reflect the views of McDermott Will and Emery LLP or its clients.</content>

		<content>Pro-Business Decisions Are Defining This Supreme Court - NYTimes.com , a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, said the Roberts court was “not particularly welcoming to efforts by plaintiffs’ lawyers to open new avenues of litigation, but it has not done much to cut back on those avenues already established by prior cases.” Business groups have been enthusiastic litigants in the Roberts court. Adam D. Chandler, a recent Yale Law School graduate and a Justice Department lawyer, published (noting that his views were not those of his employer). Looking at friend-of-the-court briefs supporting petitions seeking Supreme Court review over a roughly three-year period ended in August 2012, he found that pro-business and anti-regulatory groups accounted for more than three-quarters of the top 16 filers. “My data indicate that, as the court shapes its docket, it hears conservative voices far more often than liberal ones, and the disparity is growing,” he wrote. He found that the Chamber of Commerce was “the country’s pre-eminent petition pusher,” with 54 filings in the period. It also had an enviable success rate: the court grants one out of every hundred petitions; for ones supported by the chamber, it granted 32 percent. Ms. Todd, the chamber lawyer, said her group would continue to be active. The aftermaths of the Wal-Mart and ATandT Mobility decisions, on class actions and arbitration, “are really where a lot of our focus and resources are going right now,” she said. “These cases have a huge impact on the business community and on the American economy more broadly,” Ms. Todd said. The Comcast decision is just over a month old. But lower courts have already relied on it to reject class actions contending harm from defective trucks, poisoned drinking water, discrimination against disabled workers, misrepresentations in insurance policies and improperly docked wages. Some of the plaintiffs in those cases will now pursue their claims in individual suits. But many will not, and the businesses accused of wrongdoing will, thanks to the Roberts court, breathe a little easier.</content>

		<content>Burger King Earnings Soar as Expenses Fall - NYTimes.com Burger King's first-quarter earnings more than doubled even though revenue fell, as the fast-food chain trimmed several restaurant-related expenses. The Miami-based company had warned earlier this month that sales at established restaurants were expected to fall during the quarter, and they wound up declining 1.4 percent. That includes a 3 percent drop in the United States and Canada. Burger King said competition and a strong first quarter last year hurt U.S. and Canadian sales comparisons to this year's quarter. But it said sales from those countries rallied in March due in part to promotions like the $1.29 Whopper Jr. The company has been adjusting its strategy to focus on more menu deals like that. McDonald's has been particularly aggressive in touting its Dollar Menu to boost traffic at a time when the restaurant industry is barely growing. Wendy's also revamped its value menu recently. Overall, Burger King Worldwide Inc. said Friday its net income rose to $35.8 million, or 10 cents per share, in the quarter that ended March 31. That's up from $14.3 million, or 4 cents per share, in the previous year's quarter when it was still private. The company previously said adjusted earnings, which don't count certain one-time expenses, totaled 17 cents per share in the most recent quarter. Revenue fell about 42 percent to $327.7 million. Analysts expected $305.8 million, according to FactSet. Total restaurant expenses, which include things like food costs and payroll expenses, fell nearly 70 percent in the quarter to $108.1 million. Burger King has been undergoing a revamp since it was purchased and taken private in 2010 by 3G Capital, a private investment firm run by Brazilian billionaires. The company has been selling more restaurants to franchisees, a move that lowers overhead costs. Instead of booking sales from those restaurants, that means Burger King would collect franchise fees instead. In the first quarter, the company's restaurant revenues tumbled 69 percent to $121.1 million, but its franchise and property revenues rose 19 percent to $206.6 million. The company sold 33 company-owned restaurants in the U.S. and Canada to franchisees during the quarter for $9.3 million. Burger King said about 97 percent of its restaurants are owned and operated by independent franchisees. The company's selling, general and administrative expenses also fell about 30 percent to $66.7 million in the quarter. 3G Capital also has slashed costs, signed international expansion deals and changed the U.S. menu to appeal to a wider audience. The moves came ahead of the company's return to public trading on the New York Stock Exchange last June. Burger King says its efforts to revamp the brand remain on track. But CEO Bernardo Hees, a 3G partner, is moving on later this year to head Heinz, another 3G investment. Chief Financial Officer Daniel Schwartz, also a 3G partner, will succeed Lees as CEO at Burger King. Burger King shares rose 21 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $18.27 Friday. They have traded between $12.91 and $20.20 since relisting.</content>

		<content>Morning Take-Out - NYTimes.com An Addition to the List of Tax Loopholes | President Obama has talked about eliminating tax breaks for partners at hedge funds and private equity firms — along with those of corporate jet owners, oil companies and others taking advantage of quirks in the tax code.

		<content>Tullow Oil Finds Success Exploring Where Others Don’t - NYTimes.com The Kenya discovery is a land-based application of Mr. McCoss’s approach of finding oil in one place and then looking for analogies. After raising cash from its Uganda find by selling two-thirds to Total and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc, for $2.9 billion, Tullow went in search of similar rift valley plays in Kenya and Ethiopia. Taking advantage of the lack of interest in those countries, Tullow has been able to put together about 38,610 square miles of exploration territory, an area about the size of Indiana, for only about $23 million. There are risks, of course. The company’s earnings and market valuation will very likely be tightly pegged to the price of oil, which has fallen sharply in recent months. Deepwater exploration wells can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and a run of bad luck could sour investors. In addition, as the company expands, new finds will have less impact. The company could also run into political difficulties in countries new to oil. Already, Uganda’s government is pushing Tullow, Total and Cnooc Still, the industry is likely to keep pouring money into sub-Saharan Africa because it is less explored than other parts of the world and because of its proximity to China and other energy-hungry Asian economies. Explorers had strong years in the region in 2010 and 2011, finding the equivalent of more than five billion barrels of oil each year. This year already looks substantially better, with volumes approaching 10 billion barrels. “Africa is very much an important exploration province,” says Martin Kelly, chief sub-Saharan Africa analyst at the Edinburgh-based consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. As Tullow and other companies move into areas new to oil drilling, one concern is disruption to local environment and culture. of northern Kenya, the location of some of the richest early hominid sites on the planet. The paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey, who has been working in the area since 1968, said he was worried when Tullow obtained its licenses. In a telephone interview, Mr. Leakey said that there were still scars on the landscape from Shell’s exploration activities years ago. But Tullow’s attitude has been different, he said, giving credit to Mr. Heavey. “He has shown to be a very decent person with a very good attitude toward the responsibilities an oil company might have to an area like this,” Mr. Leakey said. He said the local people were nomadic herders, and he feared the central government would use the oil for its own purposes and just give the local people “sweets and little gestures.” Mr. Heavey said that his company was open to creative ways to share the wealth. For example, Tullow has listed its shares on the Ghana Stock Exchange. “We have to make sure we are transparent in what we do and make sure we do things properly,” Mr. Heavey said.</content>

DealBook Column View all posts Article Tools Related Links DealBook Special Section “The women at the top of organizations that I know will tell you that we think that we’ve made it because we were born the way we are and can play by these rules without feeling damaged by them,” Ms. Dorner said. “Or, we’ve learned how to play by these rules and use them to our own advantage.” “I suspect that we were simply not very good role models,” she added. “And there aren’t enough of us to be visible so that people can work out how to do what we did.” Ms. Dorner and her peers in the upper echelons — like Ruth Porat at Morgan Stanley, Joan S. Solotar of the Blackstone Group, Edith W. Cooper of Goldman Sachs and Cecelia Stewart of Citigroup — are the latest generation of women making it in a man’s world. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News, via Getty ImagesAT THE TOP Irene Dorner, chief executive of HSBC USA. Isabel Benham, who started her career as a bond analyst in 1934, was so worried about being taken seriously that she initially signed her reports using her first initial and middle name, “I. Hamilton Benham.” When Muriel Siebert became the first woman to own a seat on the New York Exchange in 1967, the Big Board had only men’s bathrooms. “Not since I was a baby had so many people been so interested in my bathroom habits,” she declared in her memoir. Ms. Dorner, who started her career in 1982 as an in-house lawyer at the merchant banking arm of Midland Bank, recounted a gathering several years later at a bar with a group of male colleagues, who she said made misogynistic comments. “It just was anachronistic — it was awful,” Ms. Dorner said. But “I didn’t complain. I, of course, ended up being the only woman there, and I have to say I had the most miserable day.” The challenges are not unique to Wall Street. While women and men appear in the broad work force in equal numbers, few women make it to the executive suite, regardless of industry. And female chief executives like Indra K. Nooyi of Pepsico, Ursula M. Burns of Xerox and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo are even rarer. Many companies are trying to close the gender gap, with varying degrees of success. Big banks have created networking and mentorship programs to cultivate talented women. As a way to bolster the number of women with computer science and engineering degrees, nonprofit groups are focusing on teaching high school girls to code. Norway requires 40 percent of the board members of public companies to be women, a model that the rest of Europe is considering. Sheryl K. Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, has helped start a national conversation over the issue with her best-selling book, “Lean In.” In it, Ms. Sandberg argues that women may be holding themselves back in the workplace “by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands and by pulling back when we should be leaning in.” Her position has prompted an angry response from some, who say Ms. Sandberg is blaming the victim. But Ms. Dorner, too, says women on Wall Street need to advocate more forcefully for themselves. In many cases, she says, the problem of the glass ceiling is matched by what she calls the “sticky floor” — that is, women who remain in lower-tier jobs because they don’t proactively try to climb the corporate ladder. “Women do funny things,” Ms. Dorner said. “They do things like work very hard and expect to be noticed for it — and they’re not, because it doesn’t work like that.” Instead, Ms. Dorner argues that women need to take a page from their counterparts in pushing their own agenda and advancement. “I don’t think we need to suddenly flip and all be acting in a male way,” Ms. Dorner said, “but you can learn something from male behavior.” “If you offer a woman a professional management opportunity or promotion — and I’ve had this happen to me — the first thing they do is produce a long list of pros and cons: ‘Oh, dear, what do I have to do with child care? I must and go tell my husband,’ “ she said. “If you offer it to a guy, he’ll just say: ‘Well, thank you very much. I’ll do the best I can.’ ” Ms. Dorner says she wishes she had spoken up earlier, by trying to reform practices and pushing for diversity programs. In her position, she said, she could have helped change the underlying cultural bias against women. “I only realized what was happening when I was 50, because there I was, making my way in the unconscious rules,” Ms. Dorner said. “I really do think the next push has got to come from the senior middle-management women who must stand up and be counted on this earlier than I did.” As she sees it, diversity is not just a moral issue, but also a good business decision. “I think that you are insane commercially if you run any corporation and you turn down the opportunity for different views, innovation and a different way of thinking.” This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: April 2, 2013 An earlier version of the article had the incorrect business that Irene Dorner runs. She is the chief executive of HSBC USA, not HSBC North America. A version of this article appeared in print on 04/03/2013, on page F1 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Women in a Man’s World.</content>

		<content>Verizon to Invest $100 Million in Solar, Fuel Cell Technology - NYTimes.com and fuel cells at 19 facilities in seven U.S. states to cut its carbon footprint and make its operations more resilient to storms and other disasters. The energy project should be complete by next year, with installations at corporate offices, call centers, data centers and central offices of the telecommunications giant in Arizona, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina. The fuel cells will be powered by natural gas, which emits less climate-warming carbon dioxide than diesel or petroleum when burned, said James Gowen, chief sustainability officer for Verizon Communications Inc. Gowen declined to say how much money the telecommunications company would save with this investment, but did say it would be good for the bottom line. "I have a CFO and a CEO who are telling me quite often, 'We are not going green for green's sake.' So we absolutely have a positive return on investment based on a 10-year net present value," Gowen said in a telephone interview. Like many other U.S. companies, Verizon aims to be more environmentally sustainable and beef up its green credentials, but another key reason for the energy shift was to bolster reliability. When Superstorm Sandy battered the U.S. East Coast last year, the fuel cells at the company's Garden City site on Long Island kept operations running when parts of the conventional power grid went down, Gowen said. ClearEdge Power will install fuel cell systems at Verizon sites in California, New Jersey and New York, the company said. Sunpower Corp. has a multi-year agreement with Verizon to put in rooftop and ground-based solar cells and solar parking canopies in Arizona, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and North Carolina. Together, these changes are expected to generate some 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually and cut the company's annual carbon footprint by more than 5,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.</content>

		<content>Wall St Week Ahead - Central Banks, Data to Steer Investors - NYTimes.com NEW YORK (Reuters) - With signs of a slower economy mounting, the near-term outlook for U.S. stocks isn't rosy, but investors may find comfort next week from the world's major central banks. The Federal Reserve will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, with the report of weaker-than-expected, first-quarter growth could reinforce expectations the Fed will keep purchasing bonds at a pace of $85 billion a month. Low interest rates and ample liquidity provided by the Fed and other central banks have buoyed global equity markets because low borrowing costs for businesses and consumers lead to richer corporate profits. Major U.S. stock indexes hit record highs earlier this month. "As long as it looks like central banks are on your side and on investors' side as far as providing more liquidity, that's going to help improve sentiment," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. "I don't think (Fed officials) have got enough data since the last meeting to really justify changing policy. I really don't think they're going to look at slowing the pace of purchases until probably September." A strong commitment from the Fed to continue its stimulative policy, coupled with corporate earnings that have mostly exceeded lowered forecasts, could help Wall Street extend a rally despite signs that the U.S. economic recovery is losing momentum. Even though the market ended flat on Friday, its performance for the week was positive. The Standard and Poor's 500 rose 1.7 percent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 percent and Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.3 percent The economy expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said on Friday, short of expectations of 3.0 percent and setting a cautious tone. A heavy slate of key economic indicators will be released next week, including personal income and spending, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing and services activity indexes, pending home sales, the Chicago purchasing managers' index and consumer confidence from the Conference Board. The highlight of the week will come on Friday when the Labor Department releases its employment report for April. Economists polled by Reuters are looking for job growth of 150,000, up from 88,000 in March. The unemployment rate is likely to remain unchanged at 7.6 percent. "Today's (GDP) data suggests maybe the momentum is much weaker that what was priced in," said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers in Newark, New Jersey. "We have had a very strong rally, so people are looking for any trigger for profit-taking," he said. Praveen said the market could see a 5 percent pullback in the months ahead should upcoming data prove weaker than expected. Stocks have had a wild run over the past week after hackers attacked the website of stock broker Charles Schwab Corp and a false report on the Associated Press's Twitter account about explosions at the White House sent the market into a brief tailspin. On Thursday, a software glitch shut down the Chicago Board Options Exchange for half the day, preventing trading in options on two of the stock market's most closely watched indexes and delivering the latest blow to confidence in the way U.S. financial markets operate. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and investors will watch to see if it delivers an interest-rate cut as the euro zone economy deteriorates further. Further monetary easing would encourage investors to buy riskier assets and boost stocks. "The market has been rallying on the fact the ECB might actually start to do something; if the U.S. market reacts in the same way, that might get the market rallying," said John Canally, investment strategist and economist for LPL Financial in Boston. With earnings reporting now half over, investors will look to see if companies can continue to exceed profit estimates despite lackluster revenue. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 271 companies in the SandP 500 that have reported earnings for the first quarter, 69 percent have beaten analysts' expectations, above the 63 percent average since 1994. However, only 43.9 percent have topped analysts' revenue forecasts, well below the 62 percent average since 2002 and the 52 percent rate for the last four quarters. Analysts now see earnings growth of 3.8 percent this quarter, up from expectations of 1.5 percent on April 1. Next week Dow components reporting results will be Pfizer and Merck. Other companies scheduled to report include Loews Corp, Aetna Inc, Chesapeake Energy, Visa Inc, Viacom Inc and Kraft Foods Group Inc. David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial, based in Boston where he helps oversee about $700 billion in assets, said the lackluster figures suggest the second quarter may not be as robust as hoped. "Right now, markets are going through an adjustment process, trying to figure out just how robust the economy is here and overseas as well," Joy said. "You have investors sort of biding their time. They are invested, but not with complete conviction."</content>

		<content>A Digital Shift on Health Data Swells Profits in an Industry - NYTimes.com of Chicago, a well-connected player in the lucrative business of digital medical records. That February, after years of behind-the-scenes lobbying by Allscripts and others, legislation to promote the use of electronic records was signed into law as part of President Obama’s economic stimulus bill. The rewards, Allscripts suggested, were at hand. But today, as doctors and hospitals struggle to make new records systems work, the clear winners are big companies like Allscripts that lobbied for that legislation and pushed aside smaller competitors. While proponents say new record-keeping technologies will one day reduce costs and improve care, profits and sales are soaring now across the records industry. At Allscripts, annual sales have more than doubled from $548 million in 2009 to an estimated $1.44 billion last year, partly reflecting daring acquisitions made on the bet that the legislation would be a boon for the industry. At the of Kansas City, Mo., sales rose 60 percent during that period. With money pouring in, top executives are enjoying Wall Street-style paydays. None of that would have happened without the health records legislation that was included in the 2009 economic stimulus bill — and the lobbying that helped produce it. Along the way, the records industry made hundreds of thousands of dollars of political contributions to both Democrats and Republicans. In some cases, the ties went deeper. Glen E. Tullman, until recently the chief executive of Allscripts, was health technology adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign. As C.E.O. of Allscripts, he visited the White House no fewer than seven times after President Obama took office in 2009, according to White House records. Mr. Tullman, who left Allscripts late last year after a boardroom power struggle, characterized his activities in Washington as an attempt to educate lawmakers and the administration. “We really haven’t done any lobbying,” Mr. Tullman said in an interview. “I think it’s very common with every administration that when they want to talk about the automotive industry, they convene automotive executives, and when they want to talk about the Internet, they convene Internet executives.” Between 2008 and 2012, a time of intense lobbying in the area around the passage of the legislation and how the rules for government incentives would be shaped, Mr. Tullman personally made $225,000 in political contributions. While tens of thousands of those dollars went to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, money was also being sprinkled toward Senator Max Baucus, the Democratic senator from Montana who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Jay D. Rockefeller, the Democrat from West Virginia who heads the Commerce Committee. Mr. Tullman said his recent personal contributions to various politicians had largely been driven by his interest in supporting President Obama and in seeing his re-election. between 2006 and last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. While its political action committee contributed a little to some Democrats in 2008, including Senator Baucus, its contributions last year went almost entirely to Republicans, with a large amount going to the Mitt Romney campaign. Current and former industry executives say that big digital records companies like Cerner, Allscripts and Epic Systems of Verona, Wis., have reaped enormous rewards because of the legislation they pushed for. “Nothing that these companies did in my eyes was spectacular,” said John Gomez, the former head of technology at Allscripts. “They grew as a result of government incentives.” Executives at smaller records companies say the legislation cemented the established companies’ leading positions in the field, making it difficult for others to break into the business and innovate. Until the 2009 legislation, growth at the leading records firms was steady; since then, it has been explosive. Annual sales growth at Cerner, for instance, has doubled to 20 percent from 10 percent. “We called it the Sunny von Bülow bill. These companies that should have been dead were being put on machines and kept alive for another few years,” said Jonathan Bush, co-founder of the cloud-based firm Athenahealth and a first cousin to former President George W. Bush. “The biggest players drew this incredible huddle around the rule-makers and the rules are ridiculously favorable to these companies and ridiculously unfavorable to society.” An article on Wednesday about the outsize profits accruing to sellers of medical records systems from a federal program they lobbied for omitted part of the name of the institution that employs Michael Callaham and Michael Blum, who expressed opposite viewpoints on how well one such system, from a company called Epic, worked. It is the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center — not merely the San Francisco Medical Center. Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the growth of electronic medical records and the profits of records companies misidentified an organization founded in November 2004 to make the case for electronic records. It is HIMSS, a group that includes health care providers, corporations and nonprofit organizations — not the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society EHR Vendor Association, a more narrowly focused trade group.</content>

		<content>Rolls-Royce Aerospace Chief Mark King Resigns - NYTimes.com PARIS — Rolls-Royce, the British engineering group, on Thursday announced the surprise resignation of Mark King as chief of its aerospace business, barely four months after the 27-year company veteran had been appointed to run the group’s most prestigious division, which builds engines for commercial and military aircraft. The company gave no explanation for the sudden departure of Mr. King, 48, in a statement to the London Stock Exchange, although a Rolls-Royce spokeswoman said it was for ‘'personal'’ reasons. that it was cooperating with an investigation by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office into alleged bribery at some of the company’s Asian business operations. Rolls-Royce said at the time that it had been contacted in early 2012 by the fraud office about concerns regarding certain civil aerospace deals in Indonesia and China in the 1980s and 1990s. The company followed up with its own internal inquiry and passed its findings on to British investigators late last year. It has since appointed Lord David Gold, a lawyer and Conservative peer, to lead an audit of its current compliance procedures. Both Rolls-Royce and the Serious Fraud Office declined to comment Thursday on whether Mr. King’s resignation was connected to the corruption investigation. Nor would they say whether Mr. King had been interviewed or had played any role in the internal or fraud office inquiries. ‘'Mark King has decided, after a lot of years doing a high-pressure job, to take a break and pursue a change of direction,'’ said Jane Terry, the Rolls-Royce spokeswoman. According to British media reports, Rolls-Royce and the fraud office have been discussing a civil settlement that would waive any criminal charges in the case in exchange for a multimillion-pound fine. Rolls-Royce and the fraud office declined to comment on those reports. Mr. King, who could not be reached for comment, is to be replaced as of June 1 by Tony Wood, currently in charge of Rolls-Royce’s marine-engine division, which builds propulsion systems for vessels ranging from luxury yachts to nuclear submarines. Mr. Wood’s duties are to be assumed by Lawrie Haynes, the head of Rolls-Royce’s nuclear energy division, who would henceforth be in charge of both the marine and nuclear businesses, the company said. Analysts and aerospace industry executives expressed shock at Mr. King’s decision to step down so soon after being promoted in January from Rolls-Royce’s head of civil aerospace — a job he had held since 2007 — to chief of the group’s combined civil and defense aerospace businesses. The two aerospace units generated more than 70 percent of Rolls-Royce’s £12.2 billion, or $19 billion, in revenue last year. Rolls-Royce is the world’s second-largest maker of aircraft engines after General Electric of the United States. ‘'Mark was well known and well respected in the aviation industry,'’ said John Leahy, chief commercial officer at Airbus, whose A380 and other wide-body jets are powered by Rolls-Royce’s Trent engines. ‘'He will surely be missed.'’ Mr. King joined Rolls-Royce in 1986 and has held various positions in engineering and manufacturing, including stints in Australia, Switzerland and the United States,</content>

		<content>Understanding Tax Increases After the Fiscal Deal - NYTimes.com “The case against hedge funds today is on the net, after-tax return,” Mr. Rubin said. “The tax inefficiency, the 2 and 20 fee and the lack of liquidity make it a tough argument.” He said investors should look for at least a 10 percent pretax return on a hedge fund investment or go somewhere else. On a more popular level, investments in life insurance and annuities can seem like good ways for money to grow tax-deferred until someone needs it. But annuities, for example, often charge high fees and restrict how long the money has to be in an account before it can be withdrawn. And it is hard to tell how much the insurance agent selling such vehicles is making from the deal — an amount that could sway how persuasive he is. Insurance is a way to defer taxes and to pay a benefit to heirs, while annuities can certainly provide a steady stream of income in later years. But buyers of both products need to consider them like any other investment, with risks as well as benefits. , there’s a clear insurance need,” said Patrick S. Boyle, investment strategist at Bessemer Trust. “When it’s sold as an investment or pure tax deferral, you just really want to understand what you’re getting and what it costs you. Then you need to make the decision if the tax deferral is worth it.” Above all, Mr. Boyle said, people should take the time to figure out how much that tax deferral will cost them, a calculation that may not be as easy as it seems with insurance. Another common tool to delay taxes is to defer income into 401(k) plans and, for senior executives, into deferred compensation plans sponsored by their companies. While 401(k) plans have contribution limits and restrictions on withdrawals until age 59 1/2, they are also protected if the company goes bankrupt. Deferred compensation plans do not have the same protection, a risk that became clear when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and executives with deferred compensation became creditors of the company. When executives decide to defer income, they also need to make some decisions that may be hard to predict, like when and how they want the payments to come back to them. “Given how high tax rates are, the longer you defer, the lower the present value of your taxes,” Mr. Boyle said. “But if something really bad happens to the company, your deferred compensation becomes subject to creditors. You might not get it or you might get part of it.” This risk to people’s financial health can be compounded if they also hold a lot of company stock. And unlike 401(k) plans, deferred income offers limited ways to withdraw money before the date you set, said Paul Lee, a national managing director at Bernstein Global Wealth Management. Two investment options attracting a lot of attention for how they are taxed are master limited partnerships and Master limited partnerships, which are usually set up to transport energy, are structured so the dividend is only partly taxed. This happens because the dividends contain what is called a return of the principal, and it lowers the immediate tax bill. Joanne E. Johnson, managing director and senior wealth adviser at J. P. Morgan Private Bank, said this was a great investment for couples in their 70s who want to maximize the yield on investments in a tax-efficient way. But the reason it works for them from a tax perspective is exactly why it would not work for couples in their mid-30s with many working years, and expenses, ahead of them. The structure of the dividend, she explained, means the part that is untaxed reduces your cost basis — essentially the price you paid for the shares. If you eventually sell the shares, the part that was untaxed when you were receiving dividends will be taxed as ordinary income. If you hold the shares until you die, the value of the partnerships will rise to their price on your date of death for estate tax purposes.

		<content>Western Union’s Singing Telegram Returns With Modern Flair - NYTimes.com THE singing telegram, once a popular way to share birthday greetings and other congratulatory messages, is returning with a twist that reflects how such sharing now often takes place digitally. , which for decades offered singing telegrams as part of its mainstay telegram service, plans to revive them on Thursday on a microsite, or special Web site, Also, the recipients of the new versions of singing telegrams will not hear Western Union employees or operators doubling as singers. Rather, in a nod to karaoke, they will hear the voices of the senders and professional performers who are chosen by the senders, working from templates. The new singing telegrams, like many online activities, will be created, assembled and produced by users. (A video clip to be available on the microsite will walk would-be senders through a five-step process to make a singing telegram.) Reflecting the global purview of Western Union, some performers will be American: Snoop Dogg and Timbaland. Others will offer an international flavor: Sunidhi Chauhan, who is Indian, and K’Naan, a Somali Canadian. Ms. Chauhan and K’Naan also take part in a cause-marketing initiative from Western Union called “World of Betters,” which is part of a new worldwide image campaign for the Western Union brand that carries the theme “Moving money for better.” The agency that is creating the brand image ads, 180 Amsterdam, which is part of the 180 division of the Omnicom Group, is also working on the singing telegrams in its role as the global creative agency of record for Western Union. Western Union plans to offer free versions of the new singing telegrams through Dec. 31, then start charging in the new year. The goal, executives say, is for the fee to be comparable to the cost of downloading a song on a Web site like iTunes, perhaps $1.99 to $2.99. “We’re bringing them back in a virtual and social way, in tune with the times,” said Diane Scott, who is executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Western Union in Englewood, Colo., as well as president of the Western Union Ventures unit. The comeback is intended as an integral element of reintroducing the Western Union brand, she added, “building on our heritage and using the passion point of music to widen access for the brand.” Western Union offered singing telegrams until 2006, when it was spun off from the First Data Corporation and focused on tasks like money transfers. The first singing telegram was delivered in 1933, when a Western Union operator named Lucille Lipps sang a birthday greeting to the actor and singer Rudy Vallee. The idea to set telegrams to song was credited to George P. Oslin, then the public relations director for Western Union, who said he wanted consumers to associate telegrams with “fun” rather than bad news like death. Before Western Union stopped offering singing telegrams, their popularity had dwindled; the company suspended the service from 1974 to 1980, when they returned with limited availability. The vacuum was filled by companies that send out employees, often wearing costumes, to sing, dance, deliver balloons or, sometimes, even strip. The Western Union executives are not concerned that many, if not most, of today’s consumers are unfamiliar with telegrams, much less singing telegrams. “If you’re a 22-year-old fan of Timbaland, you may not have a clear idea of what a telegram is,” acknowledged Marc Audrit, vice president for global creative excellence — yes, that is his title — at Western Union, who is based in Paris. “That’s O.K.,” Mr. Audrit said, because “when something that may sound dusty, unknown, is presented with something fresh, up to date, there’s a very interesting tension, an electricity from a storytelling perspective that’s intriguing.” Ms. Scott said the concept was tested with and without the use of the term “singing telegram,” and it became apparent that there was “a lot more value and impact by keeping it.” Although Ms. Scott would not disclose the budget for the campaign to revive the singing telegrams, or the overall “Moving money for better” campaign, she said Western Union usually spends about 3 to 3.5 percent of its annual revenue on marketing and advertising. With revenue of about $5 billion, that would total from $150 million to $175 million. Western Union is “an important brand with a rich heritage,” said Chris Mendola, chairman at 180 Amsterdam, who recently moved to New York from Amsterdam to look at opportunities to expand 180 in markets like China, New York and South America. And 180 will frequently find “some of the most fruitful seeds” for a contemporary campaign within a brand’s history, he added, citing clients like Adidas. By giving consumers “an opportunity to create a new music experience,” Mr. Mendola said, the singing telegram will take Western Union “beyond the cluttered world of financial services.” “We thought we could come up with a new name” for the service, he added, “but we felt, ‘Let’s tap that heritage and put new meaning to it.’ ”</content>

		<content>Higher Fares Help Southwest Airlines' Profit - NYTimes.com DALLAS (AP) — Higher fares helped Southwest Airlines Co. make more money than Wall Street expected in the first quarter, but the company said Thursday that automatic federal spending cuts could hurt revenue in April. The average passenger fare on Southwest is now more than $150 one-way, 4 percent higher than a year ago. The airline also gave details on a new policy for no-shows, and it outlined changes for its operation in Atlanta, where it competes with Delta Air Lines Inc. Southwest didn't fly to Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest airport, until it bought AirTran Airways in 2011. AirTran uses Atlanta as a hub through which passengers connected to other flights, but starting this fall Southwest will turn it into a point-to-point operation primarily serving people going to or from the city. The change, Southwest officials said, should make their operation more productive and boost its local traffic there. Southwest announced those changes as it reported that first-quarter net income fell 40 percent to $59 million, or 8 cents per share. That's down from earnings of $98 million, or 13 cents per share, a year ago, when the airline booked $116 million in net one-time gains, mostly from fuel-hedging contracts. Without special items such as fuel hedging, Southwest would have earned 7 cents per share, topping analysts' forecast of 2 cents per share, and reversing an adjusted loss of 2 cents per share last year. Revenue totaled $4.08 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago. Analysts expected $4.07 billion, according to FactSet. Southwest shares finished steady at $13.42 on Thursday after trading in a range of $13.31 to $13.61 during the day. Southwest said that revenue was weaker than expected in March and so far in April. Automatic budget cuts that went into effect in March have caused federal agencies to cut back on travel. The company said that it's "cautious" because of the potential effect of those cuts, but that recent bookings for May and June are "solid." Lower prices for fuel — Southwest's biggest expense — offset the slump in revenue in April. Its first-quarter fuel bill fell 3.5 percent compared with the same period last year, to $1.46 billion. Southwest estimated its second-quarter fuel cost at $3 to $3.05 per gallon, less than a year ago and below its forecast for 2013. The airline also unveiled details of a new no-show policy for passengers using its lowest, nonrefundable Wanna Get Away and Ding! fares. Beginning with reservations made on or after May 10, no-shows will lose the value of the unused part of their itinerary and the rest of the reservation will be canceled. Unlike most airlines, Southwest doesn't charge a fee to change a ticket, and it lets customers apply the amount of unused tickets to new bookings. But the airline believes that the policy results in seats going unsold when passengers fail to show up. On a conference call with analysts, CEO Gary Kelly was quizzed repeatedly about a glossy new advertising campaign that, unlike many previous ones, doesn't mention Southwest's policy of letting customers check two bags for free. The analysts wanted to know if the ad blitz indicated that Southwest is preparing to charge for bags. Many of them believe that Southwest could make lots more revenue by charging for bags. Kelly suggested that the analysts were parsing the commercials too closely, but he didn't close the door on bag fees someday. "There's no intent here to change the positioning of Southwest Airlines' brand with this ad campaign," Kelly said. "Our brand includes 'bags fly free,' period." Southwest still believes the bag policy draws customers. Kelly said it would lose $1 billion a year if it started charging for bags. But, he added, "I don't want us to be pinned down into perpetuity on what we might or might not do."</content>

		<content>ValueAct Takes $2 Billion Microsoft Stake - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Activist investor ValueAct Capital has taken a $2 billion stake in Microsoft Corp, according to ValueAct's chief executive, helping Microsoft shares climb to a seven-month high. The stake was confirmed by ValueAct CEO Jeffrey Ubben at an investor conference in New York, after being first reported by CNBC television. Microsoft shares rose as much as 4.8 percent to $31.18, touching their highest levels since last September, before paring gains. With Monday's jump, the stock is up 16 percent this year, putting it on track for its best annual performance since 2009. One of the chief complaints of Microsoft's investors is that the stock is little changed today from where it was 11 years ago. Ubben said at the conference that the firm will not do any public campaigning to affect Microsoft's strategy. But he did say that the world's largest software company should make Office, its most profitable product, more widely available outside of Windows. Microsoft makes web-based versions of Office applications, such as Word, Outlook and PowerPoint, and also one for Apple computers. But it does not make a native version for Apple's hot-selling iPad, which one analyst suggested could be worth $2.5 billion in annual revenue. At Friday's closing price of $29.77, a $2 billion stake would represent about 67.2 million Microsoft shares. That represents less than 1 percent of Microsoft but would be enough to make ValueAct a top-15 investor in the company, based on Thomson Reuters data. ValueAct describes its management as being experts in "sourcing investments in companies they believe to be fundamentally undervalued, and then working with management and the company's board to implement strategies that generate superior returns on invested capital." Most recently, ValueAct was involved in pushing industrial machinery maker Gardner Denver Inc to sell itself, an effort that culminated in a $3.74 billion deal with private equity firm KKR. Microsoft and Steve Ballmer, its CEO for the last 13 years, have been the targets of much criticism over the past decade, chiefly for falling behind Apple Inc and Google Inc in the shift toward mobile computing. But the company has not been subject to much overt shareholder protest. The most public challenge came two years ago, when Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn - who made his name warning about Lehman Brothers' financial health before the investment bank's collapse - called for Ballmer to step down. "His (Ballmer's) continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft's stock," Einhorn told fellow fund managers at the annual Ira Sohn Investment Research Conference in 2011. Microsoft never responded publicly to Einhorn, but Ballmer has indicated he has no plans to step down and intends to stay on for another four or five years at least. Greenlight Capital has since cut its stake. At the end of last year it held a negligible 0.13 percent of Microsoft's outstanding shares. Any attempt to force change within the company from outside would likely face opposition from its largest shareholder, Chairman and co-founder Bill Gates, who still owns 5 percent of the company. Ballmer is the third-largest holder with about 4 percent.</content>

		<content>European Central Bank May Get an Enforcement Role - NYTimes.com If the European Parliament and euro zone member states approve a plan presented on Wednesday by the European Commission, at the beginning of next year the central bank will become chief regulator of all banks in the euro zone, with the power to impose fines, remove top executives and even revoke banking licenses. The central bank would supersede national regulators, which have been accused of being overly protective of the banks they oversee and reluctant to require the lenders to grapple with their problems. But before the central bank can begin to tackle the task of regulating the more than 6,000 credit institutions in the euro zone, new staff members must be hired, money must be allocated and a clear structure must be developed to coordinate its work with the national regulators that will continue to handle most of the day-to-day tasks. No one yet has even rough estimates of how many people or how much money the central bank will need to perform the new role. Even though the European Commission’s proposal for a banking union is a big leap, it does not grant the central bank powers on a par with those of United States banking authorities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Under the current plan, the central bank would not have the resources needed to prevent bank runs or the authority to arrange a decent burial for a terminally ill institution. The plan for a banking union is a work in progress, assembled in the midst of a fast-moving crisis. It is doubtful whether the central bank’s supervision of banks will do much to ease tension in the euro zone, though it might help in the future. “They need to develop their specific operational expertise,” said Jörg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin. “I think of this as a long-term project that can prevent the next crisis from happening, to break this nexus between banks and states.” The plan outlined by the European Commission would, if ratified, give the central bank new supervisory powers on Jan. 1. But it is likely to take six months from that date for the central bank to build up the capacity to regulate just the biggest, cross-border banks in the euro zone. It could be a year before it is able to supervise all the banks. “The timetable sounds optimistic,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research firm in Brussels. Even so, if euro zone governments manage to quickly approve the proposal, it could bolster confidence that political leaders are addressing flaws in the structure of the euro zone. “It shows the Europeans are actually able to do something together,” Mr. Véron said. “That is heartening.” Handing supervisory authority to the central bank would also fulfill a condition necessary for the euro zone’s rescue fund, to take a more active role in bank bailouts. The fund, the European Stability Mechanism, would be able to directly supply banks with fresh capital and take stakes in them in return, without having to go through governments that have sometimes dawdled. It is unclear when the mechanism might be able to take on expanded powers to aid banks, but it could be within months. The mechanism moved a big step forward Wednesday after Germany’s highest court declined to block the country from participating. Still, Berlin continues to oppose giving power over all of its banks to the central bank. Germany has 1,900 credit institutions, more than double that of any other euro zone country. Many of them are small savings banks, often owned by municipalities that use them to funnel credit to local enterprises — and in some cases as a vehicle for political patronage. German landesbanks, which are larger than the savings banks but also have close ties to state and local governments, have been particularly vocal in opposing centralized bank supervision.</content>

		<content>Raymond James Invests in Training, Even as Other Firms Cut Back - NYTimes.com DALLAS (Reuters) - At a time when some larger Wall Street firms are trimming training programs to cut costs, Raymond James Financial Inc is bulking up its plan to develop the next generation of advisers. Raymond James plans to build on a highly successful program developed by Memphis-based brokerage Morgan Keegan, which it acquired last year for $1.2 billion. It will spend more to integrate its plan with Morgan Keegan's model, Paul Reilly, the chief executive of Raymond James, said. Raymond James does not break out the amount it spends on training alone, but Reilly says it will be a "top priority" for the company for 2013. "We're focused on long-term conservative growth, even as the Street wants us to cut costs," Reilly said in an interview at the company's annual conference in Dallas last week for independent Raymond James advisers. "We're looking to grow the business five years out, not this quarter." Training is a costly undertaking. Investing in younger trainees can be a gamble for firms, as it can take decades to build a book the size of veteran advisers - those who manage large pools of clients assets of around $100 million or more - and generate significant revenue for firms, said industry managers and recruiters interviewed by Reuters. In fact, the success rate of trainee programs historically has been very low, with the industry average for program completion at about only one or two for every 10 trainees. Just last week, UBS Wealth Management Americas said it was trimming its trainee program. The company said it plans to cut 50 positions from its traditional training class, and, in turn, create financial planning associate roles focused on duties such as planning questionnaires, booking client appointments and discussing client goals related to retirement and estate planning. Raymond James hopes to have its program fully up and running in the second half of the year, with a goal to reap the results from Morgan Keegan's model - which has had roughly 65 percent of its trainee class move on to full-time advising positions. Under the new program, trainees will spend the first six months in a "pre-production" period, during which they will study and test for their Series 7 and 66 broker licenses, as well as obtain life and health insurance licenses, before they can begin to generate revenue for the firm. All trainees, for the first time, will be required to eventually obtain their Certified Financial Planner designation. Trainees will be partnered with a mentor and required to do market research to identify their own future target client base. There will also be a stronger emphasis on relationship-building and financial planning through the program. Raymond James has not determined how big the program will be at this point, Brian Fowler, who is leading the program team, said. At Morgan Keegan, the goal was to have the number of trainees be roughly 10 percent of its overall adviser force of 1,000. Raymond James's increased attention on training comes at a time when some larger Wall Street firms have slashed funding or downsized training programs. Goldman Sachs late last year ended its two-year training program for its banking and investment management divisions after running it for a quarter century because it found the program was not meeting its aim of retaining new talent. And Morgan Stanley in late 2011 decided to reduce its wealth management adviser trainee hires by nearly a third to 1,250 as a part of efforts to cut $400 million in costs. "Back in the days of E.F. Hutton, they had big training centers, and they would bring guys into New York and New Jersey," said New York-based financial services recruiter Rich Schwarzkopf, a former branch manager, who said adviser training programs have since fallen by the wayside. "They're now in a situation where they don't have a lot of replacements for brokers," Schwarzkopf said.

		<content>Time Warner Profit Rises on Cable Network Strength - NYTimes.com (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc posted a higher first-quarter profit on Wednesday, as growth in its cable networks offset declines in the film, TV entertainment and publishing units. The company also stood by its earnings growth outlook for the year, although that forecast does not include the planned spin-off of the publishing business. Net income for the media company, which owns the CNN cable network, premium TV service HBO and a movie studio, rose to $720 million, or 75 cents per share, from $583 million, or 59 cents a share, a year ago. Adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share easily beat the consensus Wall Street forecast of 75 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings exceeded even the highest of the 28 estimates that made up the consensus. But revenue came in below even the lowest Wall Street expectations at $6.94 billion. Analysts were expecting $7.15 billion. Time Warner said the growth at the networks unit was offset by declines in other segments, leaving the company essentially flat year on year.</content>

		<content>LG Electronics First-Quarter Profit Sinks, TV Pain Outweighs Phone Revival - NYTimes.com SEOUL (Reuters) - LG Electronics Inc, the world's No.2 TV maker, said quarterly profit fell 13 percent as sharp price cuts resulted in razor-thin margins for its TV division, overshadowing a strong recovery in smartphones. Since late last year, LG and bigger rival Samsung Electronics Co have had to contend with unfavorable currency rates that benefit Japanese rivals, while global demand for TVs is expected to plateau this year as many consumers in developed countries already own a flat-screen TV. Smartphones sales jumped to a record 10.3 million units, helped by new high-end models. LG has overtaken Taiwan's HTC Corp to become the world's No.3 smartphone maker by sales in the fourth quarter, although its 3.2 percent market share is still dwarfed by Apple Inc and Samsung. LG said January-March operating profit fell to 349 billion won ($311.34 million), above a consensus forecast for 289 billion won from 35 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That compares with 402 billion won a year ago and 117 billion won in the previous quarter. It marks its first profit decline in year-on-year terms in five quarters after 2011 and 2012 results were revised to reflect accounting changes. While its TV troubles may not match the dire straits faced by Japanese rivals Sony Corp and Panasonic Corp, both of which are downsizing their television businesses, LG's profit margins have slipped to below 1 percent since the third quarter, compared with nearly 6 percent in the second quarter of last year. TV profits for LG tumbled 82 percent to 29.8 billion won. Its mobile business' profit improved to 133 billion won from a 31 billion won profit a year ago and 56 billion won in the fourth quarter. But that recovery, which has helped propel its share price 18 percent higher in the last three months, could slow again. Samsung introduces the latest version of its flagship Galaxy S this week and Apple is widely expected to launch a cheaper iPhone this year. Its shares fell 0.4 percent after the results, compared to a 0.8 percent decline for the broader market. ($1 = 1120.9500 Korean won)</content>

		<content>Less Glass = Fewer TVs = Lower Prices? - NYTimes.com While the world’s TV manufacturers continue to promote a rosy sales picture for the flat-panel TV industry, inside developments indicate something different. The latest sign of trouble in the industry comes from Corning Incorporated. If you think the company just makes cookware, you’re missing the bigger picture. (In fact the company is out of the cookware business; it licensed the CorningWare product line to World Kitchen in the late 1990s.) Corning is actually the world’s largest supplier of glass for LCD televisions; according to Paul Semenza, a senior vice president at DisplaySearch, Corning supplies more than half of the glass used for LCDs. Two days ago, the company announced that it was withdrawing its previous fourth-quarter sales guidance, which it had just made last month, because of slumping demand. According to James B. Flaws, Corning’s vice chairman and chief financial officer, “We now expect our fourth-quarter sales to be below our guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and earnings per share to be at the low end or below our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.28. The retail environment and the LCD supply chain are both extremely uncertain. As a result, since the display business is a significant contributor to our overall results, we are unable to offer revised guidance for the fourth quarter or for 2009 at this time.” In plain English, TV manufacturers are cutting back on production, and hence requiring fewer glass panels. Corning supplies many of the second-tier Taiwanese manufacturers, like AU Optronics, which add capacity to companies like Sharp and Sony when their own facilities cannot keep up. Production is slowing because retailers are ordering fewer sets because customers have cut back on purchases. All of which could put retailers under added pressure to cut prices further to move the TVs they already have in stock for this holiday season.</content>

		<content>Sales Growth Helps Rite Aid to First Profit Since 2007 - NYTimes.com reported its first quarterly profit in more than five years on Thursday, helped by growth in the number of prescriptions filled and higher comparable sales of general merchandise at its stores. Shares of Rite Aid, one of the largest American drugstore chains, closed up 17 cents, or 16 percent, at $1.21 on Thursday. Rite Aid raised its forecast for the year, moving away from calling for a loss to raising the possibility of turning an annual profit, even though sales may come in weaker than it previously anticipated. of $60.5 million, or 7 cents a share, for the third quarter ended Dec. 1, compared with a loss of $54.5 million, or 6 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Analysts on average expected a loss of 3 cents a share in the latest quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Since then, Rite Aid has closed many stores and remodeled hundreds of others. It has also added features to its loyalty program to entice shoppers. , which forced it to close nearly 800 of its 4,600 stores for several days, Frank G. Vitrano, the company’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call. But Rite Aid got a lift in sales when Walgreen did not fill prescriptions for patients with Express Scripts benefits plans for the first eight and a half months of the year. Rite Aid raised its outlook for the fiscal year, which now ranges from a net loss of 5 cents to a profit of 3 cents a share. Rite Aid also said it expected sales in the 2013 fiscal year of $25.15 billion to $25.3 billion, with same-store sales down 0.3 percent to 0.9 percent.</content>

		<content>Fracking Still Controversial in Europe - NYTimes.com “If companies go ahead and look to exploit all the unconventional gases they could exploit, you are looking at tens of thousands of wells over this tiny island, which is densely populated,” he said. Cuadrilla is trying to defuse the opposition. The drill rig at St. Annes sits on an impermeable membrane and has water-quality and seismic monitors, and is even surrounded by piles of rolled hay bales, lest the sight of the rig disturb the birds that feed in the fields. Climbing over the steel decks of the rig during a brief hail shower, Mr. Egan pointed to an acoustic monitor in a wire cage just beyond the fenced-in perimeter. To find out whether the gas will flow in sufficient quantities to be commercial Mr. Egan wants to drill two horizontal wells and then fracture the rock in them to measure the output. Cuadrilla has started to drill an 11,000-foot vertical well at the new site, but it still needs permission to go horizontal, and the decision to allow fracking may need to come from the highest levels of the British government. Companies that want to exploit shale gas in Europe are also learning that they must tread softly or they will go nowhere. “The days of Texas wildcatting are over. You can’t just pick a spot and drill; you have to go through lots of engagement, ” said Mr. Magness of Chevron, which has had protesters block access to sites in Poland. Exxon Mobil, which halted drilling on what it considers promising acreage in Lower Saxony in Germany in the face of local opposition in 2010, is still working to overcome fears that drilling would ruin neighborhoods. To reduce noise, the company hangs sound curtains on some of its rigs and is considering using electric motors, which are quieter than diesel-powered ones. “You’ve got to convince people it doesn’t have a negative impact,” said Tristan J. Aspray, Exxon Mobil’s exploration operations manager for Europe and Greenland. In straight economic terms, producing shale gas in Europe would appear to make a lot of sense. Europe is a big gas market and, unlike in the United States, its own gas production is declining, making it more dependent on imports from countries like Algeria, Libya and, especially, Russia. Easing this dependence is a big part of Chevron’s pitch to Eastern European countries, which are entirely dependent on Russia for their gas. “Of course this is a big chance for Europe, where we focus on energy security and understand that this might make us more independent,” said Boguslaw Sonik, a European Parliament member from Poland. Because of an editing error, a picture caption on Wednesday with an article about opposition in Europe to the use of hydraulic fracturing for oil production misidentified the plant shown and carried an incorrect credit. It is a drilling rig in England owned by Cuadrilla Resources, not a processing plant run by RusPetro of Russia, and it should have been credited to Christopher Furlong/Getty Images, not to RusPetro.</content>
