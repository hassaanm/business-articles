As the region boomed, subdivisions and office parks spread steadily over these former ranch lands, until Los Angeles County encompassed not only Los Angeles but also nearly a hundred other smaller cities. How much bigger the area can get may be a matter of geography. West and south is the Pacific Ocean. East is desert. And the Angeles National Forest and San Gabriel Mountains bound the northeast. It may not be the case that the Southern California dream has run its course here. But the dream may be running out of room. About 60 miles north of the city, though, beyond the San Gabriels, you can still find some open space untouched by the backhoes of big developers. This is the future site of the city of Centennial, population about 70,000, just off Interstate 5, but today it is still fields of rolling grassland that cattle have grazed for more than 100 years. Seen from afar, the Centennial site looks like a swatch of green-and-gold fabric, rumpled here and there in small pleats and gathers, spread over an area six miles long and three miles deep. Behind it rise the Tehachapi Mountains, and if you look closely you can see a glint of silver running through the landscape: the water of the California Aqueduct flowing south. It's a landscape that's empty and attractive and remote -- but not a place, as one developer confided to me, that's so attractive or remote as to make it off limits to a builder. Planned city of Centennial, Calif, will lie about 60 miles north of Los Angeles on 11,700 acres that are part of Tejon Ranch; Centennial's developers, Lewis Group, Tejon Ranch, Pardee Homes and Standard Pacific Homes, will build 23,000 homes over 20 years and see city as visionary model for healthy cities that are self-sustaining alternatives to sprawl; sophisticated software tools used in planning Centennial calculate everything from population diversity and density to size and locations of infrastructure components like schools, police stations and grocery stores that will best support residents; cost of Centennial's housing would be affordable to more than 70 percent of California households; photos (M) "}, "ONE": {"2013-04-29T17:24:28Z": "Business Highlights  ", "2013-04-28T23:56:09Z": "Japan's SMBC Said in Talks for TPG's Indonesia Bank Stake Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp is in advanced talks to buy a $1.3 billion (837.8 million pounds) stake in BTPN, an Indonesian lender backed by TPG Capital, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, lifting BTPN's shares 9 percent on Monday.
