Philips points to Mr. Patterson as a dedicated user of the Nino, the company's palm-size computer. Predictably, Mr. Patterson's site is a veritable shrine to the Nino. The only problem is that Mr. Patterson has not used a Nino, or, for that matter, any device running Windows CE, the simplified version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, for more than six months. Last summer, he soured on CE altogether and after a brief but happy fling with a Palm organizer, became a fervent early convert to the new Visor from Handspring, a startup that has licensed the Palm operating system.

With the relentless miniaturization of technology, the time has come for wrist devices that have function lists as long as your arm: depending on design, they double as cell phones, one-way pagers, e-mail readers, computers, cameras, MP3 music players, television receivers, voice recorders, automobile security keys, television and VCR remote controls, health monitors, weather stations, compasses, Global Positioning System monitors, altimeters, games and simple amusements. Some can even serve as admission passes for ski lifts and museums. And, almost as an afterthought, they tell time. Following the example of the pocket watch, which first moved to the wrist less than a century ago, more than a dozen different types of electronic gadgets are strapping on straps and competing for space on the narrow stretch of body between the hand and the forearm. Until the time when such devices are implanted directly into the brain, which is still some years away, the wrist is the most convenient place on the body to wear technology.

As the region boomed, subdivisions and office parks spread steadily over these former ranch lands, until Los Angeles County encompassed not only Los Angeles but also nearly a hundred other smaller cities. How much bigger the area can get may be a matter of geography. West and south is the Pacific Ocean. East is desert. And the Angeles National Forest and San Gabriel Mountains bound the northeast. It may not be the case that the Southern California dream has run its course here. But the dream may be running out of room. About 60 miles north of the city, though, beyond the San Gabriels, you can still find some open space untouched by the backhoes of big developers. This is the future site of the city of Centennial, population about 70,000, just off Interstate 5, but today it is still fields of rolling grassland that cattle have grazed for more than 100 years. Seen from afar, the Centennial site looks like a swatch of green-and-gold fabric, rumpled here and there in small pleats and gathers, spread over an area six miles long and three miles deep. Behind it rise the Tehachapi Mountains, and if you look closely you can see a glint of silver running through the landscape: the water of the California Aqueduct flowing south. It's a landscape that's empty and attractive and remote -- but not a place, as one developer confided to me, that's so attractive or remote as to make it off limits to a builder. Planned city of Centennial, Calif, will lie about 60 miles north of Los Angeles on 11,700 acres that are part of Tejon Ranch; Centennial's developers, Lewis Group, Tejon Ranch, Pardee Homes and Standard Pacific Homes, will build 23,000 homes over 20 years and see city as visionary model for healthy cities that are self-sustaining alternatives to sprawl; sophisticated software tools used in planning Centennial calculate everything from population diversity and density to size and locations of infrastructure components like schools, police stations and grocery stores that will best support residents; cost of Centennial's housing would be affordable to more than 70 percent of California households; photos (M) ": 0.01886524822695033, "Facebook Rolls Out Friends-Based Search Product Facebook Inc took the wraps off a new search tool on Tuesday that lets people trawl their network of friends to find everything from restaurants to movie recommendations, an improvement that's likely to increase competition with review websites like Yelp and potentially even Google Inc.
