''There was a fear that everything would just kind of die,'' he said recently. Video games were new and seemingly impermanent, vulnerable to business convulsions that made him fear that he was involved in a faddish ''digital Hula-Hoop'' and that ever improving graphics would render early games obsolete. There were even wild theories that spaceborne alpha rays could cause arcade machines to decay. Cosmic rays and other forces have not yet gotten the best of Mr. Jarvis's creations, which are among the most popular in the thriving market of retro games. As players age and 80's nostalgia reinvigorates interest in old games, an industry that has long focused on the present and future has become eager to herald its past.
