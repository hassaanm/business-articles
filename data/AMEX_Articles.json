With the relentless miniaturization of technology, the time has come for wrist devices that have function lists as long as your arm: depending on design, they double as cell phones, one-way pagers, e-mail readers, computers, cameras, MP3 music players, television receivers, voice recorders, automobile security keys, television and VCR remote controls, health monitors, weather stations, compasses, Global Positioning System monitors, altimeters, games and simple amusements. Some can even serve as admission passes for ski lifts and museums. And, almost as an afterthought, they tell time. Following the example of the pocket watch, which first moved to the wrist less than a century ago, more than a dozen different types of electronic gadgets are strapping on straps and competing for space on the narrow stretch of body between the hand and the forearm. Until the time when such devices are implanted directly into the brain, which is still some years away, the wrist is the most convenient place on the body to wear technology.
