		<content>For Mac Users, Help From an Unlikely Quarter IT'S never easy living as a Mac user in a Windows world, but it is a lot easier than it used to be. Microsoft, maker of Windows, was once thought to be Apple's greatest enemy. I will admit to referring to Microsoft as ''the Borg'' (taken from the dominating alien race on ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'') in those dark days of '97 when Apple's future looked shaky. But then things got better. Instead of trying to squash the Mac, Microsoft has actually spun off a unit to create Mac software from the ground up, instead of merely recycling old Windows code into Mac versions of its programs. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.5 browser for the Mac featured many technogoodies, like a page-print preview option, that were not included in the concurrent Windows versions, and Internet Explorer 5 for Mac has even more. MacIntosh users may have easier time in a Windows world now that Microsoft has spun off a unit to create Mac software from ground up, instead of merely recycling old Windows code into Mac versions of its programs (State of the Art column) (M)</content>

		<content>Apple Breaks The Mold THE last time Apple Computer introduced a fundamentally new operating system was in 1984, when System 1.0 was shipped with the original Macintosh computer. Ronald Reagan was president, Steve Jobs was the chairman of Apple, and consumers' embrace of Windows was still several years away.

Apple Computer introduces beta version of its new Mac OS X (10) operating system software, which is based on Unix operating system and has a new interface, called Aqua; people who pay $29.95 for chance to find bugs and glitches in this test version will be surveyed by company for comment; photo (M)</content>

But much of it involves the idea that a printed image can contain more than meets the eye. The bar codes used by GoCode, for example, look like little rectangles made up of white specks on black squares and a few black lines. In fact, those rectangles are a specialized type of symbol called a two-dimensional bar code. The little specks form patterns that provide an extra dimension of information than is available in a traditional bar code, which is made up of straight lines. A bar code with two white specks in the corner, for example, will send a different message than one with one speck.</content>

For Mr. Vooren, a 40-year-old native of the Netherlands who moved to New York 16 years ago to pursue acting and visual art, his new computer essentially had to do what his old one could barely manage: handle the latest high-performance programs to help him edit short films in his Brooklyn apartment, where he recently started a business, Reels 4 Artists. A DVD burner was essential, too, to save the video onto disks. Personal computer makers are counting on expanding needs of consumers to stem two years of declining sales; for two decades, sales of PC's were driven by succession of innovations and new operating systems; now, high-peformance applications are transforming computer use and requiring more bells and whistles as well as increased capacity; photos; graphs show ups and downs in market (L)</content>

		<content>Double Vision: Retinal Displays Add Data Layer THERE is a scene in ''The Terminator,'' the 1984 James Cameron movie, in which the audience sees through the robotic eyes of the title character, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. When the superintendent of a building yells at the Terminator, a list of possible responses scrolls down the screen before he chooses one to shout back. The one he picks is a doozy. Two decades ago, science fiction movies were the only place you could see a computer-generated image on top of a real-life background. By the end of 2001, a commercial product will achieve the same effect in real life by projecting images directly onto the viewer's retina, at the back of the eye. Microvision Inc develops device called Nomad that is worn on the head and beams computer-generated images through the pupil and onto nerve cells of the retina without hampering wearer's vision; photo; drawing (M)</content>

		<content>Why Doesn't Windows CE Get Any Respect?; When It Comes to Personal Organizers, Microsoft's Minisystem Does Not Rule the Market YOU wouldn't expect to find a better spokesman for the Philips Nino than Blake Patterson. If you visit the Philips Electronics Web site, you see a prominent link to a site built by Mr. Patterson, a 27-year-old Web designer from Alexandria, Va. Philips points to Mr. Patterson as a dedicated user of the Nino, the company's palm-size computer. Predictably, Mr. Patterson's site is a veritable shrine to the Nino. The only problem is that Mr. Patterson has not used a Nino, or, for that matter, any device running Windows CE, the simplified version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, for more than six months. Last summer, he soured on CE altogether and after a brief but happy fling with a Palm organizer, became a fervent early convert to the new Visor from Handspring, a startup that has licensed the Palm operating system. Mr. Patterson, who was once paid by Philips to write about the Nino, has not touched his Nino fan page since late last year and it now hangs, petrified, in cyberspace (nino.philips.com/community). Microsoft Corp has not had success with its Windows CE, simplified version of its Windows operating system, intended for use in personal organizers; according to one poll, personal digital assistants running CE account for just 15 percent of PDA's sold; 75 percent run Palm OS; reasons given for lack of interest in CE include: too expensive, too difficult to use, too bulky, poor quality; Microsoft points out that its CE system is popular for some other devices; photos (M)</content>

		<content>Neither Notebook Nor Palm SOMEHOW the niche between a palm-size organizer and a notebook has never been successfully colonized. Big companies are about to withdraw their bigger handheld entries from the market. I.B.M. withdrew months ago, and Hewlett-Packard will stop production of its larger handheld this month, although it will continue to produce its tiny handheld with non-touch-type keyboard, which has been selling well. Compaq, Sharp, NEC and a few others still make so-called PC companions, devices with keyboards that are bigger than an organizer's but smaller than a notebook's. But they run on Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, which draws its look and feel from its big brother operating system, Windows 98. And Microsoft is not saying whether it will allow the Windows CE system to fade away while it concentrates its marketing muscle on its even tinier Pocket PC software for palm-size computers. Joe Hutsko (State of the Art) column notes that as manufacturers of some palm-size organizers prepare to withdraw their bigger handheld entries from market, Psion PLC, Britain, has introduced its new Series 7 model, most powerful yet; in reviewing Series 7, Hutsko notes that it looks like notebook computer, but does not have such things as hard drive or ability to run same programs you use on desktop; says, instead, Series 7 runs scaled-down applications; notes new Psion model is size of large paperback and weighs just over 2.5 pounds; says if he did not already own Hewlet-Packard Jornada 820, Psion Series 7 would be his first choice as companion to his desktop computer (M)</content>

		<content>State of the Art; Look Out! New Wrist Devices on the Loose IT took more than half a century, but the consumer model of the Dick Tracy two-way wrist radio is almost here. With the relentless miniaturization of technology, the time has come for wrist devices that have function lists as long as your arm: depending on design, they double as cell phones, one-way pagers, e-mail readers, computers, cameras, MP3 music players, television receivers, voice recorders, automobile security keys, television and VCR remote controls, health monitors, weather stations, compasses, Global Positioning System monitors, altimeters, games and simple amusements. Some can even serve as admission passes for ski lifts and museums. And, almost as an afterthought, they tell time. Following the example of the pocket watch, which first moved to the wrist less than a century ago, more than a dozen different types of electronic gadgets are strapping on straps and competing for space on the narrow stretch of body between the hand and the forearm. Until the time when such devices are implanted directly into the brain, which is still some years away, the wrist is the most convenient place on the body to wear technology. It does not encumber the hand, does not intrude on most manual tasks, moves easily in front of the eyes and is easier to reach than, say, the ankle. Peter H Lewis State of the Art column on latest wristwatches, which have function lists far beyond telling time; says because of miniaturization of technology, newest watches double as cell phones, one-way pagers, e-mail readers, computers, cameras, MP3 music players, television receivers, voice recorders, automotible security keys, television and VCR remote controls, health monitors, weather stations, compasses, Global Positioning System monitors, altimeters, games and simple amusements; photos; diagram (M)</content>

		<content>The New Security: Cameras That Never Forget Your Face MANAGEMENT at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco had been suspicious for weeks. A houseman on the graveyard shift was not the most productive worker, and trying to reach him on his walkie-talkie was usually a lost cause. So when the employee could not be found one summer night, his bosses went to their new video surveillance system. The camera network -- using software from 3VR Security Inc., a San Francisco company that makes surveillance technology -- already knew what the houseman looked like; facial recognition algorithms had built a profile of him over time. With a couple of mouse clicks, managers combed through hours of videotape taken that night by the hotel's 16 cameras, and found every place he had been -- including the back entrance he slipped out of, three hours into his shift. He became 1 of 10 employees dismissed from the hotel since 3VR's surveillance package was installed last June.</content>

		<content>Revenge of Pac-Man: Vintage Games Are Back IN the early 1980's, when he was 25 and working on the arcade games Defender and Robotron 2084, Eugene Jarvis wasn't sure video games would last. ''There was a fear that everything would just kind of die,'' he said recently. Video games were new and seemingly impermanent, vulnerable to business convulsions that made him fear that he was involved in a faddish ''digital Hula-Hoop'' and that ever improving graphics would render early games obsolete. There were even wild theories that spaceborne alpha rays could cause arcade machines to decay. Cosmic rays and other forces have not yet gotten the best of Mr. Jarvis's creations, which are among the most popular in the thriving market of retro games. As players age and 80's nostalgia reinvigorates interest in old games, an industry that has long focused on the present and future has become eager to herald its past. Video games from 1980's are reissued by multiple manufacturers for play on modern consoles and with new retro consoles, resembling originals, with games included; photo (M)</content>

The optical discs, known as DataPlay digital media, can store up to 500 megabytes of data, almost as much as a standard compact disc. The company plans to start selling them later this year for about $10 apiece.

		<content>Online Scammers Target the Jobless When Claude Vera responded to the customer-service job opening he saw on the online-classified site Geebo.com back in February, it seemed like one of a hundred small acts that might get him back to work. Most of his e-mail messages to prospective employers were going unanswered, so he was relieved when Penguin Express Inc. replied the next day with a work-from-home job. To help him get a home office started, Penguin sent him money orders so he could buy, via money wire, the requisite laptop and other equipment from several different people. Mr. Vera, of Jamaica, New York, deposited nine United States Postal Service money orders into his Chase bank account and wired a total of nearly $8,000 to the various vendors. But he never received a laptop or anything else, and the money orders turned out to be already cashed or counterfeit. The scam consumed Mr. Vera's tax refund and put him in the red by $6,700 to Chase, which sent his case to a collection agent.</content>

He had been raised on a rich diet of visually explosive games for sophisticated consoles by Sega and Nintendo. He had also found himself playing even more interactive games that required joysticks, mice and keyboards plugged into hulking desktop computers. But these days Mr. Arellano, a computer science and finance major at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says he is increasingly enticed by a different kind of video game: the $4 or $5 variety he can play on his cellphone screen. Casual video games played on PC's, laptops, digital organizers and cellphones are designed to be brief amusements; they are easy to learn and many are direct translations of classic arcade games like Pac-Man and Tetris or digital versions of card and board games; successful casual game can be produced for as little as $40,000, does not require extensive hardware and can be easily downloaded into cellphones and Internet-enabled organizers; photos (M)</content>

In a gesture to uneasy visitors to its Web site (www.expedia.msn.com), it recently stopped insisting that they register and provide personal information before browsing for flights, car rentals and hotel rooms. The site now requires registration only when a browser turns into a purchaser. The site promises replies to e-mail messages within 24 hours, offers immediate assistance by telephone at any time and meticulously follows up sales with offers of further service. For example, after Expedia sold me two airline tickets to San Juan, P.R., it followed up a week before departure with an e-mail message suggesting that the itinerary be reviewed, and offered to book a hotel room, arrange a car rental and even buy luggage. New emphasis on customer service is being seen as Internet retailing proliferates and matures; some sites are going to great lengths to promote customer loyalty, both by streamling buying process to prevent problems and by being more receptive to solving problems that do occur; drawing (M)</content>

Made from non-silicon materials -- ceramics, in some cases -- these components present a major obstacle to further shrinking of cellphones.

		<content>Sniffing Out New Ways To Uncover Land Mines FOR decades, the United States military and international relief organizations have been searching for low-cost, effective ways to rid the world of land mines. There are more than 100 million mines buried in 70 countries, and they kill or maim more than 2,000 people per month, according to United Nations estimates. Experts agree that existing methods of detecting land mines are costly and inefficient. Metal detectors, which are commonly used, have high rates of false alarms due to the abundance of unrelated scrap metal in the soil. And many mines are composed primarily of plastic, which metal detectors cannot recognize. With more than 100 million land mines buried in 70 countries, the United States military and international relief organizations have for decades been searching for low-cost, effective ways to rid the world of these devices; Defense Applied Research Projects Agency, division of US Army, is financing several research projects in land mine detection; one of most promising projects uses technology called nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR), which seeks out explosive material rather than metal surrounding land mine; some other projects being financed agency noted; photo (M)</content>

That can cut into the services that have defined corporate banking for generations. Automakers, large retailers and industrial companies have had banking or finance operations for years to help underwrite customer purchases, raise capital or support other credit functions.

		<content>Playing Sim City For Real For much of the past century, the hills and valleys around Los Angeles have been a kind of developers' paradise, a patchwork of expansive ranches, many dating to the 1840s and 1850s, that supplied builders with a seemingly endless stock of raw acreage. As the region boomed, subdivisions and office parks spread steadily over these former ranch lands, until Los Angeles County encompassed not only Los Angeles but also nearly a hundred other smaller cities. How much bigger the area can get may be a matter of geography. West and south is the Pacific Ocean. East is desert. And the Angeles National Forest and San Gabriel Mountains bound the northeast. It may not be the case that the Southern California dream has run its course here. But the dream may be running out of room. About 60 miles north of the city, though, beyond the San Gabriels, you can still find some open space untouched by the backhoes of big developers. This is the future site of the city of Centennial, population about 70,000, just off Interstate 5, but today it is still fields of rolling grassland that cattle have grazed for more than 100 years. Seen from afar, the Centennial site looks like a swatch of green-and-gold fabric, rumpled here and there in small pleats and gathers, spread over an area six miles long and three miles deep. Behind it rise the Tehachapi Mountains, and if you look closely you can see a glint of silver running through the landscape: the water of the California Aqueduct flowing south. It's a landscape that's empty and attractive and remote -- but not a place, as one developer confided to me, that's so attractive or remote as to make it off limits to a builder. Planned city of Centennial, Calif, will lie about 60 miles north of Los Angeles on 11,700 acres that are part of Tejon Ranch; Centennial's developers, Lewis Group, Tejon Ranch, Pardee Homes and Standard Pacific Homes, will build 23,000 homes over 20 years and see city as visionary model for healthy cities that are self-sustaining alternatives to sprawl; sophisticated software tools used in planning Centennial calculate everything from population diversity and density to size and locations of infrastructure components like schools, police stations and grocery stores that will best support residents; cost of Centennial's housing would be affordable to more than 70 percent of California households; photos (M)</content>

		<content>For Efficiency, Light-Emitting Diodes May Turn to Carbon THE current color flat-panel displays do everything backward. First, the screen is lighted to its full brightness by a battery-draining lamp. Then a series of color filters and tiny liquid crystal displays, or L.C.D.'s, block most of that light to create on-screen images. Since light-emitting diodes, as their name suggests, actually generate their own light while using very little battery power, they have long been viewed as an obviously better way to create displays. Unfortunately, while conventional L.E.D.'s work well in giant screens and advertising displays like those in Times Square, they cannot easily be used to create small, high-resolution screens for portable computers. New light-emitting diodes, made of plastics and other carbon-based materials rather than silicon, promise greater efficiency and less eyestrain for computer users; drawing (M)</content>

For decades, the idea sat gathering dust. Intel, of course, went on to dominate semiconductor manufacturing, and today Mr. Moore, 73, says through a spokesman that he does not remember the article, which appeared in the September 1970 issue of the journal Electronics. Mr. Ovshinsky, now 79, moved on to other applications for his thin films, including the first rewriteable CD's and flexible solar-energy cells. Chip makers are seeking replacement for flash and other types of memory in use in wireless industry and may end up reverting to technologies that have been shelved for many years; ovonic unified memory was described in technical article written 32 years ago by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore and inventor Stanley Ovshinsky and is sparking interest today along with other technologies that were abandoned years ago; drawing (M)</content>
