		<content>Coming Soon To a Hand Near You REMEMBER the first Walkman? It has been almost a quarter-century since Sony's portable cassette player changed the way people listen to music on the go. Now another form of entertainment is getting the Walkman treatment. Palm-size portable video players are beginning to change where and how people watch movies, cartoons and music videos. The gadgets, which play compressed video files on a small screen, are designed to be generally less expensive and more convenient than portable DVD players, which have been available for several years. None of these new-generation players, in fact, play DVD's. Instead, using advances in storage and compression technology, most store video on hard drives or memory cards, much the way digital audio players store music files. Palm-size portable video players, which play compressed files on small screen, are beginning to change how people watch videos and are designed to be less expensive and more convenient than portable DVD players; Archos and Hasbro have both released players; industry experts warn that providing legal content for devices is and will continue to be major obstacle; game company Nintendo is hastening development of players, calculating that they will appeal to young people who are already used to small, relatively low resolution screen; photos (M)</content>

		<content>If You Behave Yourself, I'll Print You a Toy VIEWED through the fantastic lens of science fiction, three-dimensional printers seem as amazing as the transporters in ''Star Trek.'' In goes a digital idea of a thing and out comes the thing itself. In practice, three-dimensional printing is fairly mundane. Many such machines use a computer-controlled stream of a chemical or laser light to bind a powdery material, layer by layer, into an object. Just as a modern printer uses billions of tiny dots to produce images, three-dimensional printers arrange billions of tiny flecks of plastic or metal to produce objects. Computers ensure that the billions of bits end up in the right place, a process that can take several hours or even a day. How It Works column explains three-dimensional printing; such printers are being used by industrial designers to create prototypes of parts and other objects, by arranging stream of chemical or laser light to bind powdery material, layer by layer, into object; technology is currently very expensive, but some companies are considering possibility of producing lower-priced version that could generate everyday items; series of illustrations shows how it works (M)</content>

Try Satellite IBRAHIM MARDAM-BEY, an international corporate financier, recently decided he could not live another day without a fast connection to the Internet from his home in Bethesda, Md. After giving up on the wait for a digital subscriber line, or D.S.L., he became a beta tester early last month for a new two-way satellite service from StarBand, a startup company in McLean, Va. Just how helpful a fast connection could be became clear two weeks after the system was installed, when his wife's mother and sister were aboard a Saudi Arabian airliner that was hijacked. Up-to-the-minute news was difficult to get, and the most reliable dispatches, he said, came from overseas, streaming via satellite connection into his PC. Satellite access to the Internet emerges from shadow of cable modem and DSL service, which are not available to an estimated 50 million households in US; StarBand two-way satellite service promises download speeds of up to 500 kilobits per second, only slightly slower than DSL or cable modem service; Hughes Network Systems is also preparing to begin a two-way service, and Wildblue is building its own satellites to begin a consumer service in 2002; photo (M)</content>
